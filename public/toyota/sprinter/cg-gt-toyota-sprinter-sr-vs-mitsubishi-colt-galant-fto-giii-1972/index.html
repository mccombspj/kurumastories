Comparison test: Toyota Sprinter SR vs. Mitsubishi Galant FTO GIII
This month, we comparatively tested two 1400cc sports cars, the Toyota Sprinter SR and the Mitsubishi Galant FTO GIII, under a variety of conditions, including on the Yatabe test course. I would like to briefly explain why we chose these two models from the many cars in the same class. The Sprinter SR is the best in its class in terms of specs, and is the best for those of us who just enjoy motoring (and I think this includes many C/G readers), so we chose it without question. The Galant GTO GIII has just been released, and since I drove the GII last month and was impressed with its handling, I was particularly interested in how the GIII, which has 9ps more power, would behave, so I added it. When I think of Sprinters, the Nissan Sunny GX also immediately comes to mind. In our opinion, though, the Sunny Coupe 1200GX is best, and the Excellent, which has had its engine replaced with a SOHC 1400, is a donwngrade in every aspect (except for the brake servo), so we deliberately left it out of this comparison. To avoid any misunderstanding, we should add that the C/G test is first and foremost a test of &ldquo;driving&rdquo; performance, and we place importance on the balance of maneuverability and braking power that matches the power performance. This is especially true of cars that are marketed as being sporty.">

<p><b><u>Comparison test: Toyota Sprinter SR vs. Mitsubishi Galant FTO GIII</b></u></p>
<p>This month, we comparatively tested two 1400cc sports cars, the Toyota Sprinter SR and the Mitsubishi Galant FTO GIII, under a variety of conditions, including on the Yatabe test course. I would like to briefly explain why we chose these two models from the many cars in the same class. The Sprinter SR is the best in its class in terms of specs, and is the best for those of us who just enjoy motoring (and I think this includes many C/G readers), so we chose it without question. The Galant GTO GIII has just been released, and since I drove the GII last month and was impressed with its handling, I was particularly interested in how the GIII, which has 9ps more power, would behave, so I added it. When I think of Sprinters, the Nissan Sunny GX also immediately comes to mind. In our opinion, though, the Sunny Coupe 1200GX is best, and the Excellent, which has had its engine replaced with a SOHC 1400, is a donwngrade in every aspect (except for the brake servo), so we deliberately left it out of this comparison. To avoid any misunderstanding, we should add that the C/G test is first and foremost a test of &ldquo;driving&rdquo; performance, and we place importance on the balance of maneuverability and braking power that matches the power performance. This is especially true of cars that are marketed as being sporty.</p>
<p>The Sprinter SR is the hottest Corolla, and appeared in April 1971. It was only available as a two-door coupe, and there was no four-door sedan version like the SL, which used the same engine. The crossflow OHV 1407cc engine had a compression ratio of 9.6 (or 8.5 on regular gasoline models) and twin carburetors, producing 95ps/6000rpm (91ps/6000 in the regular gas version) and 12.3kgm/4000rpm (12.0kgm/4000rpm). Its biggest feature was that it came standard with a 5-speed gearbox. Cars of this size and character that have 5-speed gearboxes are very rare internationally, and the only one I can think of is the Alfa Romeo 1300GT Junior. The ordinary suspension, with MacPherson struts and a leaf-spring rigid rear axle, is even stiffer than the SL&rsquo;s, and the stabilizer is also thicker at 19mm in diameter. The SR, which is dedicated to driving, comes standard with radial tires, but does not even have a radio, which is naturally expected in domestic cars. Te price is slightly cheaper than the SL at 644,000 yen.</p>
<p>While the basic design of the Sprinter SR dates back to the 1966 Corolla 1100 sedan, the Galant FTO, which was announced in October 1971, is much newer in terms of design year. However, almost all of the powertrain and suspension, except for the engine, are the same as those of the Galant 14/16L and GTO. Therefore, the FTO, which has the same track as those models, but with a 120mm shorter wheelbase and a body that is 150kg lighter, had the potential for excellent handling from the start due to its wide track. The OHV 1378cc engine with short pushrods is exclusive to the FTO, but it can basically be said that to be an enlarged version of the old 11F/Colt 1200 series engine. The GIII engine, the sportiest of the FTOs, has a compression ratio of 9.5 and two Stromberg-type carburetors, producing 95ps/6300rpm and 12.3kgm/4500rpm. Apart from this engine tuning and the addition of servo brakes, the GIII is virtually identical to the GII. The base price of the GIII is 660,000 yen, but if you add the &ldquo;mandatory optional equipment&rdquo; (a strange term that reminds me of my college days) that came with our test car, such as the 155SR-13 radial tires and rear window defogger, the price comes to 682,000 yen, which is considerably more expensive than the Sprinter SR.</p>
<p>Comparing the specs of the two cars, the engine output and torque are exactly the same, and the vehicle weight is 840kg for the SR and 835kg for the GIII, so the power-to-weight ratio is also the same at 8.8kg/ps for both. The tire size is also the same at 155SR-13, and the final drive ratio is 4.30 for the SR and 4.22 for the GIII, so gearing is essentially the same. The only differences are the GIII&rsquo;s four-speed gearbox versus the SR&rsquo;s a five-speed, and the shape of the body.</p>
<p><b><u>Power performance</b></u></p>
<p>The Sprinter/Corolla engine, with its hemispherical combustion chambers and V-shaped valve arrangement, is well-known for its high-revving performance despite being an OHV. This is expecially true for the 95ps SR model, which, with its twin-carburetor setup, can be fully utilized up to the redline of 6500rpm. However, it is by no means particularly quiet or smooth, and noise (mainly fan and exhaust resonance) increases suddenly once it passes 3500rpm.</p>
<p>The SR&rsquo;s greatest attraction is its 5-speed gearbox. The gear ratio spacing and final drive ratio are well matched to the engine&rsquo;s power characteristics, and this engine generates strong, relatively flat torque throughout the practical rotation range from 1500 to over 6000rpm, so the upper three gears of the 5-speed gearbox have a large overlap in their operating range. For example, overtaking at 60-100km/h, which is often done on the highway, can be done in third, fourth, or fifth gear depending on the need and mood. In fifth gear, it takes 15.2 seconds, while in third gear it is quick at 7.2 seconds. The ratios of this 5-speed gearbox are very Alfa-like, and the 0.861 fifth gear is not only for high-speed cruising, but there is also a chance to use it frequently on slow Japanese roads. If you feel like it, you can use fifth from 60km/h (about 2000rpm), and if you step on it with another 100rpm, it will accelerate decisively.</p>
<p>The shift pattern is the same international standard as Alfa Romeo (Porsche finally changed to this pattern in 1972), with fifth gear located up and to the right. The gear lever is always pushed by a spring towards the third-fourth plane, so to shift down from fifth to fourth, you lightly pull it down and into the fourth gear slot, so you can shift quickly and confidently.</p>
<p>Acceleration is extremely fast for a 1.4-liter engine. The clutch and throttle are smooth, and you can easily start quickly very little wheelspin. 0-400m took 18.2 seconds. This is achieved by it up to the redline of 6500rpm through the gears, and there is no point in pushing it any further because the torque drops off rapidly.</p>
<p>In the top speed test at Yatabe, the car recorded 163km/h in fifth gear (5600rpm), and 151km/h in direct fourth gear (6450rpm). The speedometer was unusually accurate at 100k/h, and pessimistic at top speed, reading 159km/h. The legal cruising speed on the highway, 100km/h, is only 3500rpm in fifth gear, so the interior is relatively quiet. However, over 120km/h the wind noise around the window frames suddenly becomes quite loud. Speaking of noise, the gearbox is also noisy, especially in second gear. Also, when you switch from fourth gear to overdrive fifth, the engine noise drops and a faint gear whine begins.</p>
<p>During the top speed test at Yatabe, there was a small mishap. The car suddenly lost power and its speed dropped, and upon investigation, it was found that one of the spark plugs had melted, causing a hole in the number 3 cylinder. From the beginning of the test, the car&rsquo;s engine had been knocking when accelerating in high gear, even at around 3000rpm, and it exhibited a dieseling tendency where the engine would not stop even after the ignition was turned off. These were signs of trouble, but when the test was repeated a few days later, both of these issues had been resolved. It is safe to assume that this was an accidental breakdown caused by insufficient maintenance.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in last month&rsquo;s issue, I tested the Galant FTO GII with a single Stromberg carburetor and 86ps, and was very impressed with its quick-revving engine and excellent handling, but in comparison, the 95ps GIII left me less impressed. It certainly revs smoothly up to the redline of 6600rpm, but that was the same with the GII. The biggest culprit that made the impression worse was the noise. The engine fan gets very noisy about 5000rpm, but even noisier was the differential. It was particularly bad when strong throttle inputs were applied. As a result, the noise when starting off and accelerating in first and second gear was terrible, giving the impression that the car is in a much lower gear than it actually is.</p>
<p>The differential seems to tbe the Achilles&rsquo; Heel of the Galant series. Every Galant we have driven has had terrible differential noise, and we have had to replace the differential twice in the 46,000km (mostly in Tokyo driving) of our C/G 1300cc AI Custom sedan. We would like to make this point and request that the manufacturer take immediate action.</p>
<p>The FTO GII&rsquo;s 86ps is perfectly adequate for practical use, but it felt a bit underpowered for sporty driving on mountain roads. However, the GIII is definitely more powerful, especially in the stronger torque available from 3000 to 5000rpm, which is the most important range for practical use. This was evident during a hill climb. On the test hill that we always use, the GII was almost always at the limit of 6600rpm in second gear, but the GIII was able to easily reach 80% of the limit at 4500rpm in third gear. The strong mid-range torque was also demonstrated when the Sprinter broke down at Yatabe, as mentioned above, and the GIII towed it back to Tokyo. It was easy to drive at 40 to 50km/h (2200-2800rpm) in this situation, and the water temperature gauge did not change at all from normal.</p>
<p>The top speed was 154km/h (6050rpm), which was a bit disappointing compared to the GII, which also achieved a recorded speed of 150km/h (6250rpm) using 6.15-13 tires, slightly larger than radials.</p>
<p>The advantage of the FTO is that it is easy for anyone to drive. The main reasons for this are the flexible engine, the light and easy-to-use clutch and gearbox, and the ideal layout of the pedals, which allows heel-and-toeing to be done naturally. Shifting is light and easy, allowing for quick and pleasant operation. However, the acceleration time from zero is spoiled considerably by the insufficient location of the rear axle. There is no problem with a normal start, but the axle moves wildly when full throttle is applied, making it difficult to get a clean start. This is true for all Galants except the GTO MR, which is equipped with a torque rod. Due to this phenomenon, the 0-400m time was 18.5 seconds, 0.3 seconds slower than the SR.</p>
<p>The gear ratios of the 4-speed gearbox are a handicap when it comes to going fast. The gap between third and top gear is particularly large, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like downshifting into third to overtake on the highway at 100km/h or more. Even though this engine has twin carburetors, the top-end power is not as strong as the low and mid-range power, so I didn&rsquo;t want to push it too hard. Given this characteristic, the current gear ratio seems a little too short. A taller final drive ratio and lower engine revs would improve not only absolute speed but also acceleration. As it stands, it is relatively under-geared.</p>
<p>Comparing the performance dynamics of the two cars, the winner is completely clear. In terms of both absolute speed and acceleration, the SR is far superior. If the power is the same (both the output and the torque are the same in the specs, but intuitively the SR&rsquo;s 95ps is much more powerful), then the difference in the top speed is due to the power in the overdrive fifth gear. Besides this, the overdrive improves fuel consumption, noise levels, and vibration during high-speed cruising, so it is also preferable in practical terms. At least as far as the test cars are concerned, the SR has a wider effective engine revolution range, while the GIII struggles at the top end. Therefore, when the FTO is driven at 100 to 120km/h (which is now a common cruising speed on the highway, regardless of engine size), it is effectively limited to just one forward gear, fourth, while the SR driver can always select fourth or fifth gear at will, and acceleration and deceleration are faster and easier.</p>
<p>In terms of starting acceleration, the 0-100km/h times are 13.2 seconds for the SR and 13.9 seconds for the GIII, so the difference is not that great, but there is a difference of 1.8 seconds in the 0-120km/h times (where both cars are at the limit of third gear), and furthermore, the times are 30.5 seconds and 38.6 seconds from 0-140km/h, a huge difference of 8.1 seconds. Since acceleration in the 120-140km/h range of this test is done in fourth gear, this can be said to be purely the difference in driving force at engine speeds around 4800-5600rpm.</p>
<p>The data on overtaking acceleratin clearly shows that the SR has stronger torque across the entire rev range. Again, the tire diameter is the same for both cars, and the final drive ratio is virtually the same, 4.30 for the SR and 4.22 for the GIII. Looking at top gear acceleration from 40 to 80km/h, the SR&rsquo;s time is 10.6 seconds and the GIII is 12.3 seconds, with the former being 1.7 seconds faster. The gap only grows as speeds increase, with the SR being 2.1 seconds faster from 60 to 100km/h and 3.4 seconds faster from 80 to 120km/h. So, is the SR&rsquo;s engine a high-speed type? Not really, it is simply more tenacious and easier to use than the FTO, even at low speeds, which is nothing other than the efficiency of the hemispherical combustion chambers and the wedge type valve arrangement.</p>
<p><b><u>Fuel economy</b></u></p>
<p>Both cars have twin two-barrel carburetors, and compression ratios are 9.6 for the SR, 9.5 for the GIII. Both require super gasoline. Constant speed fuel economy was measured at 60km/h and 100km/h in top gear (both fourth and fifth gear, in the SR&rsquo;s case). In fourth gear, the SR returned 14.1km/l and the GIII 14.6km/l at 60km/h, and the SR was 11.4km/l and the GIII 14.6km/l at 100km/h, with the FTO being slightly better in both cases. However, in the fifth overdrive gear of the SR, it showed good results of 17.1km/l at 60km/h and 12.5km/l at 100km/h.</p>
<p>Practical fuel economy was recorded on a round trip from Tokyo to Hakone. On the Tomei Expressway, the SR made heavy use of fifth gear, so it was thought that it would probably surpass the FTO, but in the end, both vehicles averaged 10.8km/l in a coincidental tie. It is clear that the SR is better for cruising on the Tomei Expressway, but on the Hakone hill climb, I ended up having fun shifting in and out of fifth more than necessary, so that probably cancelled out the difference. Both have a gasoline tank capacity of 45 liters.</p>
<p><b><u>Handling, ride comfort, and brakes</b></u></p>
<p>I drove the Sprinter SR with its standard Bridgestone RD201 radial tires set to pressures of 2.0kg/2.0kg. The steering system is highly rigid, and there was no free play when going straight, a common problem with Toyota cars. The steering response is moderately sharp and accurate. There is strong understeer, but it is never excessive. When you lift your right foot in the middle of a corner, the car cuts quite strongly to the inside, which is similar to a front-wheel-drive car (which tend to have weak cornering). The cornering grip of the RD201s is high, at least on dry roads, and they rarely squeal. However, on roads other than smooth ones like a circuit, the rear wheels tend to jump, and they may lose contact with the ground for a moment and jump sideways. Also, in tight corners, the roll angle is large despite the stiff springs, and the inside rear wheel tends to lift, resulting in severe wheelspin. The SR&rsquo;s forte is a series of medium-speed corners at 80-100km/h. There is very little roll in these corners, and turning from left to right is crisp. The powerful third gear makes it fun to drive very fast on this kind of road.</p>
<p>Road noise is well eliminated, and the roughness of the radial tires is not noticeable even on rough roads. The ride is certainly firm, and there is constant pitching, especially at low speeds, but there is no bottoming or floating even on large disturbances such as bridges. In short, it is an absolutely ideal ride for those who like to buy this type of car.</p>
<p>The disc/drum brakes with no servo require a lot of pressure regardless of speed, but they are very effective. The feeling is similar to using brakes with hard pads that are fitted with a servo, but the servo is not functioning. In practical terms, the SR&rsquo;s brakes are really the limit of what can be used without a servo. If I were the car&rsquo;s designer, I would install one. There is remarkably little nose dive during sudden braking.</p>
<p>The Galant FTO GIII&rsquo;s Yokohama GT Special tires, also 155SR-13s, were also set to a pressure of 2.0kg/2.0kg, and frankly speaking, this suspension is better suited to a good quality bias-ply tire than a radial. This is because, first of all, the noise insulation from the road surface is insufficient for a 1972 model, and the roughness of the radials is faithfully transmitted fo the body. Last month, when I drove the 86ps GII equipped with Yokohama Y205 bias-ply tires, I thought the FTO was a very quiet car, but this time, with the car on radials, my impression changed completely.</p>
<p>In terms of handling, I felt that the GII with bias-ply tires was better balanced overall and easier to handle. It is true that the steering response of the GIII  with radials is much sharper (and at the same time, quite heavy), and the cornering speed is slightly faster. However, it is not much of an exaggeration to say that the delicate balance between power and suspension that existed in the GII is destroyed in the GIII with the power increased to 95ps and the tires changed to radials. I am interested to see what kind of handling the GIII would display when equipped with good bias-ply tires. Of course, this is in extreme conditions, and in normal high-speed driving, the GIII&rsquo;s handling is not a problem at all. Understeer is moderate, and even if you close the throttle in the middle of a corner, there is only a slight change in the trajectory.</p>
<p>The ride is much stiffer with radial tires than with bias-plies (the suspension settings are the same as the GII), but the ride is still not as stiff as in the Sprinter SR. The ride in the front and rear seats is very different, as the rear passengers are jolted up and down strongly by bumps in the road.</p>
<p>The servo-equipped disc/drum brakes use &ldquo;soft&rdquo; pads designed for use without a servo. I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to test them, but they made fade if used harshly. The servo-less GII&rsquo;s brakes were also light and powerful (although the master cylinder diameter is naturally different), so they probably use pads made of the same material. Note that the Sprinter uses single-cylinder calipers, while the FTO uses opposed-cylinder ones.</p>
<p><b><u>Room and equipment</b></u></p>
<p>Both cars&rsquo; front seats have generously sized reclining backrests, and the driving positions are like that of a good sports car, with arms and legs fully stretched out. The driving positions of both cars are so similar that you won&rsquo;t feel any discomfort when switching from one to the other. Both steering wheels are moderately low (the angle of the FTO&rsquo;s wheel can be adjusted) so they don&rsquo;t obstruct the view and the gauges are easy to read. The SR&rsquo;s steering wheel is wrapped in real leather, while the FTO&rsquo;s has a clever imitation that looks like leather no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>As for smaller controls, the horn push button on the spokes of the SR can be operated while holding the steering wheel, which is great, but in the FTO you have to push the pad in the center. The frequently used light switches are located on the dash in both cars, and the SR&rsquo;s too far away when the driver has the three-point seat belt fastened. The FTO has a toggle switch, which is a little better, but I would like to be able to use one on a stalk that comes out of the steering column. The wiper/washer in the FTO is built into the indicator stalk, which is good. The SR&rsquo;s wiper/washer switch is also on the dash, and unlike the light switch, you inconveniently have to operate it with the left hand. The pedals in the FTO are in a position that makes them easier to operate while keeping your heels on the floor. However, heel-and-toeing is easy in both cars.</p>
<p>The SR has better rear seat comfort. Two people can sit in a natural position in the rear of the SR, but in the FTO, unless the driver is very small and moves the seat forward, the rear passengers&rsquo; knees are tight against the seatback.</p>
<p>As for the heaters and ventilators, the SR is much better. The minor controls are easy to operate and allow fine adjustments. In contrast, the heater in the FTO is either extremely hot or not hot at all, and there is no intermediate fine adjustment, so you have to adjust the lever constantly all year round. Also, the on/off knobs for the face-level vents on both ends of the FTO&rsquo;s dash are set way back, making them difficult to operate while driving. In general, I have to say that Toyota&rsquo;s interior design is superior. As mentioned above, the SR has simpler accessories, and does not come with a radio, lighter, or center console, but instead comes standard with radials and finned wipers. The FTO naturally comes with an AM radio, lighter, console, and so on, but the radials are a 16,000 yen option.</p>
<p>The trunks of both cars are deep but narrow, and the openings are relatively small. The spare tire is placed under the floor in both cars, so in the event of a flat tire, all the cargo must be removed. The Toyota has a much larger number of standard tools, and they are of better quality. The Toyota includes a spanner set, and adjustable wrench, two screwdrivers, a spark plug wrench, pliers, a wheel wrench, and even a tire brake.</p>
<p>Instead of a conclusion that summarizes the test data, I would like to conclude by stating my personal choice. Of these two cars, I would undoubtedly choose the Sprinter SR. Although these cars have the same 95ps output, the SR is much more lively, both in terms of intuitive feeling and in terms of test data. It is more fun to drive, and the 5-speed gearbox is certainly a big attraction. Moreover, the price of the SR, 644,000 yen, includes radial tires, and adding radial tires to the basic 660,000 yen FTO GIII will raise its price to 676,000 yen. I would rather have the GI (608,000 yen) with single carburetor and bias-plies, which has a good balance between power and suspension. The SR is a tough car with a tough feel, whereas the FTO has a softer feel and will be more widely accepted. It is easy to operate and is more compact than the SR, so it is especially suitable for use in the city. The Ford Capri-like styling and its newness on the market will surely appeal to many people.</p>
