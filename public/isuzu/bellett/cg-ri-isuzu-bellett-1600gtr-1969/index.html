Road testing the Isuzu Bellett 1600GTR
When Paul Frere came to Japan, he said that his favorite among all the Japanese cars he test drove was the Bellett 1600GT, which had been tuned to be low and stiff. He also suggested that the Bellett GTX, which was racing with a twin-cam engine from the 117 Coupe, be made commercially available. The manufacturer seemed to be interested in this, and almost immediately, the car was released under the name 1600GTR (Tokyo price, 1.16 million yen). The general outline of the GTR compared to the GT is that the suspension has been lowered and stiffened to conventional Stage I (for gymkhana) standards, radial tires have been fitted, and it is equipped with the same DOHC four-cylinder engine as the 117 Coupe.">

<p><b><u>Road testing the Isuzu Bellett 1600GTR</b></u></p>
<p>When Paul Frere came to Japan, he said that his favorite among all the Japanese cars he test drove was the Bellett 1600GT, which had been tuned to be low and stiff. He also suggested that the Bellett GTX, which was racing with a twin-cam engine from the 117 Coupe, be made commercially available. The manufacturer seemed to be interested in this, and almost immediately, the car was released under the name 1600GTR (Tokyo price, 1.16 million yen). The general outline of the GTR compared to the GT is that the suspension has been lowered and stiffened to conventional Stage I (for gymkhana) standards, radial tires have been fitted, and it is equipped with the same DOHC four-cylinder engine as the 117 Coupe.</p>
<p>Although the 117 and the GTR use the same engine, as is evident by their body styles, the 117 is a Gran Turismo that runs gracefully on the highway, while the GTR is designed for high speed and is hot enough to participate in gymkhana as it is. However, it is not an unruly horse and is extremely easy to drive.</p>
<p>The powertrain is the same as the 117, with the same engine, clutch, and gearbox and the standard final drive ratio is 3.73, the same as the 1600GT. This twin-cam engine is already well-known for its quick acceleration and smoothness up to high rpm. Unofficial overtaking times (all taken in fourth gear) show that strong torque is obtained on average up to at least 140km/h (above which air resistance increases suddenly). Since there is power to spare, consistent acceleration is obtained no matter what rpm you press the gas. The top speed of 190km/h in the catalog data is likely to be achieved without any exaggeration.</p>
<p>The test car ran roughly at around 2500rpm due to misadjusted carburetors (two Solexes, twin choke), but it was smooth otherwise and revved well up to 7000rpm (the yellow zone is marked from 6500rpm, red zone from 7000rpm). There was little mechanical noise even at speeds over 100km/h, and the loudest noise was the muffled exhaust sound, which you could tell from the sudden silence when the clutch was released. The exhaust sound started to fill the cabin at around 4000rpm (120km/h), then became quiet again around 4500rpm. Also, a whirring noise from the tires (Yokohama GT Specials) was heard up to about 100km/h, but after switching to Bridgestone radials, it completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The idling speed of 900rpm is a little rough, and there is a lot of vibration. The very short shift lever protruding from the floor tunnel is unique to Isuzu vehicles. Its action has a nice &ldquo;click&rdquo; to it, but it takes quite a bit of force to operate. The clutch engages cleanly and smoothly.</p>
<p>One of the car&rsquo;s greatest features is its outstanding maneuverability. This is largely due to the low (10mm lower than the GT) and stiff suspension. As mentioned above, it is tuned to be close to Stage I, and the spring constants compared to the standard 1600GT are much higher (5.3kg/mm vs 3.1kg/mm for the front coils, 3.5kg/mm vs 0.9kg/mm for the rear leaves, and with three leaves instead of one).  The stabilizer and rear coil springs remain unchanged, but the dampers have been strengthened both front and rear.</p>
<p>The rack-and-pinion steering feels a little heavy at low speeds, but the response at high speeds is sharp and almost completely free of play. It has excellent straight-line stability, so you can drive it without worry even when letting go of the wheel at high speeds.</p>
<p>This feeling is especially noticeable when speeding down a winding road. There is almost no body roll even when cornering at high speeds, and the radial tires have good grip. I once experienced this while driving on the winding Metropolitan Expressway. The traffic around me seemed to have suddenly slowed down, and when I glanced at the speedometer, I realized for the first time that I was going at a fairly high speed. The stiff suspension demonstrated outstanding handling for a swing axle, and although the slight initial understeer turned into final oversteer, the tail slide was easily controlled with delicate application of the throttle.</p>
<p>Although the handling is excellent, it is inevitable that the ride comfort is sacrificed to some extent. The stiff springs and stiff tires pick up the unevenness of the road surface, and the steering is rough in its kickback, though the leather-wrapped wheelrim absorbs it to some extent to isolate it from your hands.</p>
<p>On unpaved country roads, the springs again feel stiff, so there is some bouncing, but it&rsquo;s not enough to upset your stomach, and the ride quality isn&rsquo;t so bad that you need to worry. The Bellett has always had a good ride on rough roads, and while the kickback, noise, and vibration gives it a bad impression, this probably won&rsquo;t be a big deal for people considering buying a GTR. On gravel roads, the differential lock is effective and prevents one-wheel spin. This differential lock was previously an option.</p>
<p>The brakes are a disc/Alfin drum combination, with highly fade-resistant pads. These type M33S pads (M59 for the GT) require more pedal effort, and a vacuum servo has been added to compensate. A pressure control valve has also been added to prevent the rear wheels from locking too early under sudden braking, improving their reliability at high speeds. In city driving, the pedal effort is still heavy, but the stability at high speeds and the smooth braking feel are excellent. The front-rear balance is also good, and there is no servo lag. The handbrake on the floor is also easy to use.</p>
<p>Next, regarding the interior, the front seats have a unique backrest that is extended up high and doubles as a headrest, the fore-and-aft seat slide travel is more than sufficient, and the bucket type seat provides excellent lateral support. However, the backrest integrated with the headrest impairs the view diagonally rearward when backing up. The steering wheel is a three-spoke design wrapped in leather as mentioned above, and the slightly thick grip feels great to the touch.</p>
<p>The driving position is unique to the Bellett GT, with the seat low and the steering wheel and dashboard positioned high. When you adjust the seat to fit the steering wheel and shift lever, you realize that the pedals are too close. It would be better if the brake and clutch pedals were a little further away, so that their position when fully depressed was their normal resting position. There is also a big difference in height between the brake pedal and the accelerator pedal, so heel-and-toeing is not that easy. The dashboard is basically the same as the 1600GT, and the instrument panel is painted black. The wipers and bonnet are painted matte black to prevent reflections, but if this is the intention, then the chrome rings around the gauges should also be removed.</p>
<p>By the current standards of the class, the Bellett has a small body size, and the GT&rsquo;s rear seats are only auxiliary in their accommodations. For tall people, even if you set the front seat all the way forward, the knee room and head room are at their limits, and in the GTR, the front seats integrated with the headrests make foward visibility poor, and make it difficult to avoid the feeling of being crammed into a small space. Therefore, it&rsquo;s a three-seater at best. Some of the small accessories that stand out are the heated defogger wire in the rear window, a washer that works simultaneously with the wipers, and standard halogen fog lights (which also light up the gauges and tail lamps).</p>
<p>Finally, the fuel economy was 9.2km/l on average for a 300km round trip to FISCO on the Tomei Expressway and driving around Tokyo, which is a relatively good figure for this type of vehicle. Although this article only provides a brief impression, we are planning to conduct a full-scale road test at a later date, so please look forward to it.</p>
