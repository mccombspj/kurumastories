<p><b>Summary:</b> The ultimate Bellett GT. In exchange for a stiff ride at low speeds and excessive noise at high speeds, the performance and maneuverability are the best in the class, the steering is quick and unmatched, the power-off oversteer caused by the rear swing axle is moderately suppressed, it is extremely fast and exciting on winding roads, and even with limited space in the back seat, it is a very good car. It is effectively a 2+2. The poor ventilation and heating system shows the age of the design.</p>
<p><b><u>Road testing the Isuzu Bellett 1600GTR</b></u></p>
<p>A full-scale test of the Bellett 1600GTR had been on the agenda for a long time. When it debuted in the fall of 1969, this editor had just broken his left leg, and was hesitant to use the GTR&rsquo;s heavy clutch for a long time with his leg still in a cast, so I left a simple road impression for the editorial staff to publish. Since then, there has been a steady stream of strong letters from enthusiastic Bellett fans calling for another test of the GTR. This reached a peak when, for various reasons, the Bellett 1600GTR was not included in the 1.6-liter sports coupe comparison test in the August 1970 issue of C/G, and letters of indignation piled up on the desk. This clearly shows how the Bellett has captured the hearts of its enthusiastic fans, even though they are few in number, and how the GTR is their ideal model. We share the same enthusiasm for testing the GTR in earnest, so we decided to bring it forward this time, even though we knew it was a little late.</p>
<p>After driving the Bellett GTR for the first time in a long time, I was reminded that this car, which is an old car in many ways, still has the best handling among domestically produced cars. First of all, the suspension of the GTR is much stiffer than that of the GT. The spring constant of the front coil springs has been increased from 3.5kg/mm to 5.3kg/mm, and while the rear coil springs are the same, the number of transverse leaf springs has been increased from one to three, and the spring constant has been increased from 0.9kg/mm to 3.1kg/mm. The dampers are also much stronger, with 160kg rebound and 43kg compression (0.3m/sec) for both front and rear. The ride height is also 10mm lower. These specifications are almost the same as the Stage II suspension kit available for the Bellett GT. The tires are 165HR-13 radials on 4.5J rims as standard equipment.</p>
<p>The steering of the GTR is unrivalled in its quickness, not only in Japanese cars, where steering is generally unreasonably sluggish, but also in European GTs and sports sedans. During this test, the car was driven alongside a 117 Coupe EC, and the contrast between the two cars is so striking that it is hard to believe they are made by the same manufacturer. The C/G testers who switched from the 117, which has extremely strong understeer, to the GTR found that the steering was so sharp and light tht they turned the wheel too far and had to turn it back in the first two or three corners.</p>
<p>Even on normal roads, the GTR, with its stiff springs and sharp steering, is fun to corner exceptionally quickly, but turning really fast on a circuit requires a bit of special technique and careful control. The 120ps is more than enough for a 970kg car, so as long as you are in the right gear, you can turn corners quickly and tightly with delicate steering and throttle inputs. The reason why the GTR can do this is, of course, due to the characteristics of the rear swing axle, but it is also a basic weakness of this car. If you ease off the throttle while turning a corner quite quickly, the nose suddenly tucks inward, just like a front-wheel-drive car (though for a completely different reason), which shows that there is moderate understeer with the power on. With the standard 165HR-13 radials (Yokohama GT Special XXs on the test car), if you turn the power on into a corner, the outside front wheel will eventually lose grip (quite suddenly). Therefore, to turn corners quickly with the standard tires, you instinctively take the following approach:</p>
<p>First, aim straight for the apex of the corner, brake just before the apex, and at the same time, turn the steering wheel slightly. Then, the rear wheels of the swing axle, which have become lighter due to the forward weight transfer, take a positive camber, and since the contact with the road is reduced, they slide easily, making the turn tighter than is aimed for with the angle of the steering. Once the direction has changed, you immediately switch to full acceleration. In other words, instead of taking corners at the maximum radius of curvature as in normal situations, the car takes a line that connects two straight lines with a very small arc, taking advantage of the oversteer of the swing axle.</p>
<p>This method has two advantages. First, it is faster than a normal line with a large radius because it takes the shortest distance. Second, it goes straight until just before the corner, so the braking point can be delayed. This was a method favored by Stirling Moss in races, and he often used it to overtake faster cars in the braking area. Of course, you can&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t take corners like this on public roads, but it&rsquo;s good to remember it as a special handling technique for the GTR. However, what you should be careful of is to never make sudden turns of the steering wheel. Sudden braking and steering is a no-no in any car, but in the GTR, even though the axle is low and stiff, it still has the weakness of a swing axle, so in the worst case scenario, it can easily lead to the car spinning out of control.</p>
<p>The steering is moderately light except at very slow speeds. The price of this excellent maneuverability is the strong steering kickback, and concrete joints and cat&rsquo;s eyes can not only be heard but also felt directly by the hands. At Yatabe, we tried driving on a gravel road similar to a rally course, and the effect of the all-wheel independent suspension and limited-slip differential was remarkable, and we confirmed that the straight-line stability was particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>The brakes are a combination of discs and Alfin drums, and the pads are M33S type (M59 for the GT) which are highly fade-resistant. The increase in pedal force is compensated for by the installation of small diameter Hydromaster servos. Also, the rear wheel brake circuit is fitted with a proportioning valve (PCV) to prevent early locking for complete security. The braking force is commensurate with the GTR&rsquo;s dynamic performance. The pedal force is generally large by modern standards, even with a servo, and this feeling is particularly strong at low speeds in the city. However, the effect is gradual according to the pedal force, the front and rear balance is good, and they are the type of brakes that can be trusted in an emergency. In the 0-100-0 fade test, the pedal force only increased by about 20% on the tenth pass, and it is also desirable that there is little nose dive during sudden braking.</p>
<p>As expected, with the exception of top speed, the GTR&rsquo;s power performance was confirmed to be at an extremely high level for a 1.6-liter class engine, even by global standards. It is slightly slower than the Galant GTO MR (125ps/6800rpm, 14.5kgm/5000rpm, power-to-weight 7.8kg/ps), and is on par with the Celica GT (115ps/6400rpm, 14.5kgm/5200rpm, power-to-weight 8.2kg/ps). Needless to say, both of those models have five-speed gearboxes, while the Bellett has a four-speed.</p>
<p>The tire sizes of all three cars are 165-13, but the final gear ratios of the two cars with 5-speed overdrives are larger (GTO 4.22, Celica 4.11, Bellett 3.73), so the Bellett should be at a disadvantage in the 0-1000m acceleration test, where at least half the time is spent in top gear. However, in reality, the Bellett&rsquo;s time (31.9 seconds) is almost the same as the Celica (32.0) and GTO (31.2), probably because the higher gear ratio (and therefore less driving force) is offset by the smaller frontal area of the body.</p>
<p>However, I was very disappointed in terms of top speed. The day before we went to Yatabe, the engine seemed to be in good condition when I drove fast on the Tomei Expressway, but when I actually did the top speed test at Yatabe, the engine would not rev at all in third or fourth gears. In the lower gears, it had no problem revving over 7000rpm, but in third gear it would not rev above 6000rpm, and in fourth gear it would not rev above 5100rpm. Therefore, the top speed was a dismal 147.5km/h on average over a 1km straight line.We suspected there was a problem with the ignition system, so we cleaned the spark plugs and tried various other measures, but to no avail. We had asked the manufacturer to perform thorough maintenance a month before the test, but it was clearly due to an engine malfunction, and it is certain that this is far from the GTR&rsquo;s true capabilities (quoted as 190km/h in the catalog, about 6700rpm in fourth gear). This is very disappointing for us, and we intend to retest the car as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fuel economy, especially in a car of this nature, varies greatly depending on driving patterns. First, the constant speed fuel economy is as follows: 16.1 km/l at 60km/h, 13.1km/l at 100km/h, and 7.6km/l at 140km/h. In terms of practical fuel economy, we saw a worst of 6.8km/l over a 227km stretch that included the testing at Yatabe, a best of 8.5km/l while driving at medium speed from Yatabe to Tokyo, and 7.5km/l while driving on the Tomei Expressway and Hakone at high speed. The test car consumed a lot of oil, and it was necessary to top off one liter during the total test distance of 604km.</p>
<p>The four gear ratios are just right for the power and weight of the car. If it revs up to 7000rpm, it can reach speeds of 58, 102, and 143km/h in first, second, and third gears. The engine itself is unusually flexible for a high-output unit, but because it is relatively high geared, 40km/h (about 1400rpm) is the minimum speed at which it can run smoothly at a constant speed. As mentioned above, it was not working well at the top end in third or fourth gear, but it was completely normal up to about 150km/h and maintained good performance throughout the four days of testing. During a cold start in the morning, I simply pumped the pedal a few times without a choke, and the twin Solex carburetors sucked in raw gas, and it immediately started up and smoothly idled at 900rpm. The compression ratio is high at 10.3, so if you suddenly press the pedal from below 2000rpm, it will detonate for an instant, but apart from that, the throttle response is sharp over a very wide range.  The engine itself is extremely smooth at any speed from idle up to 7000rpm, but the engine mounts seem to be very rigid, so minute vibrations are constantly transmitted to the body. The drivetrain is also very rigid, and it responds immediately to the throttle, just like a rear-engine or front-wheel-drive car without a long propeller shaft.</p>
<p>The noise level is generally high by modern standards, but it is inevitable to some extent for an old car with a long design history. For hardcore GTR enthusiasts, the noise at high speeds is probably just a small price to pay for high performance. The day of our test was in bad weather with a momentary wind speed of about 15m per second, but the impact of crosswinds was not significant, and in fact, it turned out that it was affected far less than the 117 Coupe I drove the same day. Against a headwind, the 117 Coupe could barely maintain a speed of 140km/h, but the GTR was able to maintain a speed 10km/h faster than that with ease. Its straight-line stability in no-wind conditions was unparalleled, and it literally ran as straight as an arrow. Under ideal conditions, 160km/h (about 5600rpm) would be a perfectly reasonable cruising speed.</p>
<p>The small, lightweight GTR uses the same engine and gear ratios as the 117 Coupe, so a four-speed transmission is sufficient, and there is no need for a five-speed gearbox. The thick, short gear lever is well-positioned, and shifts are quick and reliable. The early Belletts had a lot of gear noise, but this has now been improved to the point where there is no complaint. Similarly, the clutch is heavy to operate, but the short stroke, for a Japanese car, is preferable. The limited-slip differential makes it difficult to induce wheelspin when accelerating suddenly, so clutch slip must be used, but the clutch is well suited to this type of use. The pedals are well positioned, and heel-and-toeing is very natural.</p>
<p>The GTR is effectively a two-seater, with the narrow rear seat only usable as a spare seat to squeeze two people into in a pinch. If you look at it that way, it&rsquo;s a very comfortable two-seater, and if you combine the back seat and the trunk, you can load up plenty of travel gear for long journeys, and the driving position is excellent. Coming from a recent car that feels like you&rsquo;re in a glass box, where you can see out well but are also feel exposed to the outside, the GTR with its small glass area and low seats gives you an indescribable feeling of security. The thick leather-wrapped steering wheel is relatively high, and the scuttle is also high, giving it the same posture as an Italian GT, like an Alfa, with its high-back seat that doubles as a headrest.</p>
<p>The seat is very comfortable, the front cabin is spacious enough, and it is hard to understand why manufacturers unnecessarily widen car bodies every time they release a new model. The two-point seat belts are insufficient for the character of this car. The heater and ventilator show the age of the design. The heater can only be controlled by the booster speed, and temperature control is not possible from inside the car, as it is controlled by a cock on the side of the engine. The nozzles on both sides of the dash only blow hot air in conjunction with the heater, and cool air at face level is only possible through the triangular vent windows. Since ventilation is insufficient, the windows tend to fog up in the rain, so the standard rear window defogger is appreciated.</p>
<p>Certainly, the Bellett GTR, whose basic design is nearly ten years old, is an old-fashioned car in many ways. On the other hand, it shows careful design and construction in many places, something that would never be allowed in a modern, thoroughly standardized product. The only real problems are the heater and ventilator, and if these small details can be improved, the Bellett GTR will have a long life ahead of it. However, the price of 1.1 million yen is a big obstacle. Still, long live the Bellett!</p>
<p>Supplement</p>
<p>As you all know, the 1600GTR we tested in last month&rsquo;s issue had an engine that was not in perfect condition, resulting in a dismal top speed of 147.5km/h (average in a 1km straight line). In first and second gears it could easily reach 7000rpm, but in third gear it could not rev over 6000rpm, and in fourth gear it could not rev over 5100rpm. This is certainly far from the GTR&rsquo;s true potential (190km/h according to the catalog), and we ourselves, as well as Bellett fans across the country, felt very sorry about this, so this month we decided to try the Yatabe test again just to check the speed. The test car is the same, but the carburetors have overhauled and the distributor has been replaced, among other adjustments.</p>
<p>This time, the test results are estimated to be the true average performance for a completely stock GTR. This time, even in third gear it could easily reach 7000rpm, and even at top speed in fourth, it was just over 6000rpm. The C/G top speed test was carried out by continuously driving at full speed around the 5.5km circuit at Yatabe, measuring both the time required for the flat 1km section on the two long straights, and the overall 5.5km lap time. On this day, the south wind was blowing at a maximum of 4m/sec and an average of 2m/sec, so the best speed on the 1km straight line was 182.0km/h, and the speed on the side that was negatively affected by the wind was 179.1km/h. Due to the running resistance of the banking and the fact that there was a section where the wind was blowing directly against us (although there was also a tailwind when driving the opposite direction), the average speed for the 5.5km lap was consistently 179.0km/h. The engine speed at this top speed was 6050rpm in the section where it was the highest, and at its lowest it never dropped below 5900rpm.</p>
<p>The tachometer was, as usual, a little lenient, as was the speedometer. At the top speed, when the actual speed was about 180km/h, the car&rsquo;s speedometer indicated 195km/h. Although the accuracy of the tachometer could not be measured, about 5% lower than the estimated value from the power performance chart (calculated value, not considering the change due to the centrifugal force of the tire diameter). Even considering the increase in tire diameter, it seemed that the displayed engine speed was slightly lower than the actual speed. The acceleration times from zero were almost the same as the data from last month&rsquo;s test. However, when starting suddenly, the engine would go wild enough to hit something in the car&rsquo;s body the moment the clutch was quickly engaged, making it difficult to make a clean start. This phenomenon did not occur when we tested the car last month, and as a result, the acceleration time from 0-400m was at least 0.1 second slower than before. On the other hand, performance after shifting into third and fourth gears improved due to the engine&rsquo;s better performance, so the 0-1000m acceleration time was actually improved by 0.2 seconds.</p>
<p>To summarize what was confirmed in the second test, the 1600GTR&rsquo;s power performance&ndash;a top speed of 182.0km/h and a 0-400m time of 16.8 seconds&ndash;is still at the cutting edge of 1.6-liter GT coupes in the world today. When compared to cars in the same class with similar 1.6-liter DOHC engines, the results are as follows: Bellett GTR, 179.0km/h maximum speed, 0-400m in 16.8 seconds; GTO MR, 182.0 km/h maximum speed, 0-400m in 16.3 seconds; Celica GT, 176.8km/h maximum speed, 0-400m in 16.8 seconds. Needless to say, the other two cars are equipped with five-speed gearboxes, while the Bellett has the disadvantage of a four-speed, but the Bellett is smaller and lighter, which is likely to offset that disadvantage. Of course, the overall points of the small body, such as roominess (especially in the rear seat), noise level, and ride comfort are considerably lower than modern standards, but this is inevitable considering the age of the design.</p>
<p>The condition of the engine remained constant throughout the test period. Even when the car was kept at top speed and repeatedly lapping for more than 10 minutes, the water temperature remained constant at 85°C, but the oil pressure dropped slightly. However, long-term cruising at 160km/h (about 5600rpm) was well within the safe range. Also, the Yokohama GT Special XX 165HR-13 tires started out at 1.8kg/2.1kg pressures, but when checked immediately after the speed test, the air pressure had risen to 2.0kg/2.4kg, which was also within the normal range.</p>
