However, looking back, we can see that an intense development process had been quietly and tirelessly continuing behind the scenes over the past two years. Having thoroughly tested the now-released Isuzu 117 Coupe over a 500km drive, we realized that the two-year wait was not in vain. Some manufacturers reluctantly release vehicles when are still in the &amp;ldquo;prototype&amp;rdquo; stage of development due to demands from their sales departments. Others fearlessly declare that they would not hesitate to buy such a car immediately after its release. However, the attitude of the people involved in the design and production of the Isuzu 117 Coupe is different, and in a sense, conscientious. Until their conscience as engineers had convinced them, they refused to put a &amp;ldquo;half-baked&amp;rdquo; car into production, no matter how strong the demands of the sales department.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
