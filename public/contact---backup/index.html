Who am I Contacting?
My name is Patrick McCombs. I’m a lifelong car enthusiast with a deep affinity for Japan’s culture and history, interests that fused after meeting my wife, who is from Nagasaki, and through our regular travels there. A spark truly lit when I stumbled upon the Mega Web museum&#39;s History Garage in Odaiba on a visit to Tokyo, and first saw the country’s iconic 1960s–70s cars in person. Since then, I’ve been collecting and translating period Japanese automotive journalism to share how these machines reflected a remarkable era of change. This site is my small way of preserving those stories. I am based in the US in California&#39;s San Francisco Bay Area, where we live with our two children.">
