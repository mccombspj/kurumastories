<p><b><u>Road testing the Skyline 2000GT-X Hardtop</b></u></p>
<p>The top-of-the-line model of the Skyline series, which now seems to have become Nissan&rsquo;s cash cow (apart from the GT-R, which has a completely different character), is the 2000GT-X Hardtop, which was added to the lineup of variations in the fall of 1971. Just recently, a GT-X version was also released for the four-door 2000GT sedan.</p>
<p>The GT-X is a model with a lightly tuned version of the GT&rsquo;s six-cylinder 1998cc engine, adding twin SU carburetors while keeping the compression ratio unchanged, and it comes standard with a car stereo and seats with tricot inserts. It is the first in the GT series to offer a 5-speed gearbox with Porsche synchro (as an option, costing 40,000 yen more), and the GT-X&rsquo;s Tokyo price is 98,000 yen higher than the standard GT for the Hardtop, and 75,000 yen higher for the sedan, at 993,000 yen and 935,000 yen, respectively. A 3-speed automatic transmission is available on both GT-Xs and can be added for 55,000 yen.</p>
<p>The engine is the same as in the Cedrix GX and base Fairlady Z, and the premium gasoline version has a maximum output of 130ps/6000rpm and a maximum torque of 17.5kgm/4400rpm (the regular gasoline version produces 125ps/6000rpm and 17/0kgm/4400rpm), which is only 10ps and 0.5kgm more than the standard, single carburetor 2000GT. The optional 5-speed gearbox is based on that of the GT-R, with only the first and second gear ratios made shorter, and of course fifth gear is an overdrive ratio. The final drive ratio remains unchanged at 3.90, so the overall ratio is significantly higher than the GT&rsquo;s. The gear ratios for the GT-X are 3.321 / 2.077 / 1.308 / 1.000 / 0.864, while those of the 4-speed GT are 3.592 / 2.246 / 1.415 / 1.000.</p>
<p>Having missed out on the hardtop 2000GT-X at the time of its release, we immediately requested for Nissan to send us a sedan GT-X to test the combination of the SU twin-carb engine and the 5-speed gearbox in this newest model. However, Nissan&rsquo;s PR department advised that only the hardtop 2000GT-X was available, and I headed to Hakone in the hardtop, knowing that it would be a little late for a report on it. The test car, which had been driven about 13,000km, was a premium gasoline model, and fortunately had the optional 5-speed gearbox. The tires were also optional Bridgestone Radial 11s, in size 165SR-14.</p>
<p>In our previous test of the Skyline Hardtop 2000GT, we noted that its single-carburetor engine easily revs up to over 7000rpm, has sufficient flexibility even at low speeds, and is quiet. These characteristics are inhereted in the GT-X. In fact, despite the tall gear ratio, the engine is tenacious at low speeds in the city, and even if you can&rsquo;t quite use fifth gear, you can get enough acceleration in fourth gear from 1000rpm, or just under 40km/h, to keep up with the flow of traffic. Or, if you prefer a sportier driving style, you can use only first and second gears (which can reliably reach speeds of over 80km/h) in the city, making it a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.</p>
<p>The engine seemed adequate in the city, but once I got on the highway and started cruising at high speed, I was a little disappointed. There was no problem with cruising at a constant speed, but when overtaking at around 100km/h, it just didn&rsquo;t have the expected punch. Cruising at 100km/h corresponds to 2800rpm in fifth gear, and 3200rpm in fourth gear, so it&rsquo;s natural that acceleration is a little sluggish from that point. But even when shifting down to third gear, which raises the revolutions to 4200rpm, just before the power peak, the impression of acceleration was not much different, and it was still a little sluggish.</p>
<p>At first I thought it might be because the gear ratios of third, fourth, and fifth gear were close together, but it soon became clear that the engine was not producing the power listed in the catalog. This was because it took more than five minutes to warm up (and didn&rsquo;t accelerate smoothly until it reached its normal temperature), and the power dropped off drastically from around 5500rpm despite it being a twin carburetor. As you might guess, the main reason is that the carburetor settings are kept as lean as possible to comply with exhaust gas regulations, and our honest impression was that the maximum output was just under 100ps.</p>
<p>However, apart from this point, the GT-X can be said to be a comfortable highway cruiser. It has excellent straight-line stability up to 160km/h, and even when using fourth and sometimes third gear instead of fifth, the noise level at high speeds is far below that of most domestic cars, and it has sufficient resistance to crosswinds. Especially within the legal maximum speed range, it is possible to drive in complete peace and quiet, and even the speedometer is relaxed, indicating 100km/h at an actual speed of 95.5km/h.</p>
<p>On the mountain roads of Hakone, the tall gear ratio and the apparent power shortfall conspire together to make the car feel even more sluggish. In particular, in second and third gears, which are used frequently, the car lacks punch when overtaking (this is largely due to the psychological effect of the engine not having the sharpness that is characteristic of a twin carburetor), so it was necessary to select a gear one step lower than usual. A 5-speed gearbox that adds an overdrive on top of the standard 4-speed gearbox&rsquo;s ratios would be better for this car (and this power).</p>
<p>Ironically, the suspension has been improved to compensate for the relatively underpowered performance, and as a result, the car has a relatively high level of maneuverability. The steering has about 10cm of play when going straight, so it requires an exaggerated movement when starting to turn, but once you start cornering, the front wheels respond smoothly and obediently. Although steering work is quite busy due to the large diameter wheel, it is always light. In other words, it is neither sluggish nor overly sensitive, making it suitable for drivers of average skill level.</p>
<p>The same goes for the GT-X&rsquo;s cornering characteristics, as it maintains stable understeer in turns, and the degree of understeer does not increase much even when the speed is increased, making it easy to control. It does not have enough power to induce rear wheel breakaway, and control inputs during cornering, such as braking, have little effect on the car&rsquo;s posture, so it can be said to be extremely safe. However, if there is a bump mid-corner, care must be taken as the wheels have a tendency to jump around quite a bit.</p>
<p>The Bridgestone Radial 11 tires on the test car, while having poor adhesion, were a good match for the car&rsquo;s maneuverability and power. On the day, the tire pressures were set to the high-speed specification (2.0/2.1kg), and even though the tires were only running at low speeds, they still squealed when cornering, but they were easier to control than tires that bite well and break away suddenly. The front disc and rear drum brakes are also one of the the good points of this car. The discs squeaked a lot at low speeds, but the pedal was always light and they worked reliably from any speed.</p>
<p>The ride is excellent regardless of speed or road surface thanks to the long wheelbase, moderately firm suspension, and good seats. However, the rear seats have 70mm less legroom than the sedan, and you have to be prepared for slightly larger jolts from below.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of fuel economy, our 350km test drive, including a round trip to Hakone on the Tomei Expressway and driving in the city, recorded 7.9km/l, the best of any Skyline in the 2000GT series tested by C/G to date. This is partly due to the effect of using fourth and fifth gears half-and-half while driving on the Tomei Expressway, but it is more likely due to the lean fuel mixture. Even so, the 50-liter fuel tank shared with the 1500/1800 series is insufficient for a long-distance touring car. Oil consumption was zero during the test period.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the GT-X&rsquo;s 10ps increase over the standard 2000GT (120ps) is offset by the higher overall gear ratio, and its acceleration feels rather slower. It&rsquo;s good for those who want quiet and refined high-speed driving, but for those who want a sporty driving style, the 4-speed gearbox would be more suitable.</p>
