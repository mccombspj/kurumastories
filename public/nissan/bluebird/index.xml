One is the Bluebird 1600SSS, and the other is the Toyota 1600GT. We immediately assembled both cars to conduct an Auto Sport test. So, which one came out on top?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Built With the Experience of International Rallies: Bluebird SSS Reborn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Both are equipped with 115ps engines and 5-speed gearboxes, but the Bluebird&amp;rsquo;s hardtop body is slightly larger and weighs about 60kg more. Needless to say, the Celica GTV is equipped with a DOHC 1588cc engine and two Mikuni Solex 40PHH twin-choke carburetors, while the Bluebird U 1600 SSS-E is equipped with the same Bosch electronic fuel injection as its big brother, the 1800 SSS-E. As mentioned above, both cars have an output of 115ps, but the power peak is 6400rpm for the Celica and 6200rpm for the Bluebird, and the maximum torque is 14.5kgm/5200 and 14.6kgm/4400rpm, respectively, so it can be said that the DOHC Celica is a higher-revving car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is our honest first impression after testing the Bluebird U 2000GT-X. As explained in detail in this month&amp;rsquo;s new model introduction, this new Bluebird U GT is based on the body of the Bluebird U that was introduced in August 1971, with an extended nose just like the Skyline GT, and a six-cylinder engine crammed into an engine bay originally intended for a four-cylinder engine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on our experience of testing several 1.6-liter and 1.8-liter Bluebird Us, it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem necessary to equip the car with a six-cylinder engine.  If there was a reason for this, it would be Nissan&amp;rsquo;s usual commercial policy of using engines from high-end models that have already proven their worth in top-of-the-line compact cars (the Skyline and Laurel are good examples of this). But if their goal was to bank on the popularity of the so-called &amp;ldquo;Sky G&amp;rdquo; and come up with a similar Bluebird, it would have been a very easy, predictable, and extremely stale product plan. However, what was somewhat reassuring when we actually drove it was that it has a more balanced chassis than any L20-equipped car we have ever experienced. On the other hand, the power performance was once again disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
