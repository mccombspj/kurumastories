Prior to its announcement to the general public, a test drive was held for the press, going from Tokyo to Hakone and back. This C/G editor, who has now recovered from his leg injury, also participated, so I would like to share my brief impressions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Despite its attractive specs, maneuverability is only average among domestic cars, while ride comfort and livability are excellent. As with the AP model, fuel economy is poor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Road testing the Luce Hardtop GS II&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new Mazda Luce series was just announced last October, and for this report, we tested the top-of-the-line, high-performance hardtop GS II over a distance of about 850km. We had already had the opportunity to test drive this model for a short time immediately after its announcement, and were particularly impressed by its handling, which was far superior to that of previous Mazda mass-market cars. In the road test in last month&amp;rsquo;s issue, we covered the sedan GR AP model, which is equipped with a thermal reactor for exhaust emission control, which is currently a hot topic. Contrary to what you might imagine from the &amp;ldquo;emissions-controlled&amp;rdquo; label, the engine in that car produces effective power, and the excellent automatic transmission is well matched to it. Another thing that made a strong impression was the well-balanced chassis, even when fitted with ordinary 6.45-13-4PR bias-ply tires on 5J x 13-inch wheels (which are still on the wide side for a Japanese passenger car).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
