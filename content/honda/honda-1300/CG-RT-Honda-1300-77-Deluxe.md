<b><u>Road testing the Honda 1300 77 Deluxe</b></u>





Few cars have been as controversial in recent years as the Honda 1300. Technically, it is an ambitious design that features a powerful, double-wall air-cooled, dry-sump lubricated four-cylinder engine, mounted transversely and driving the front wheels, following in the footsteps of the ill-fated Honda F1 racing car, the RA302, and attracted the attention of engineers both in Japan and abroad. However, for two or three months after its release on April 15 last year, the Honda 1300 had still not appeared on the streets. At the time, the automotive world was abuzz with the issue of defective cars, and dark rumors were circulating that the 1300 might also be part of the problem (in reality, it was said that the measures to deal with the "defects" in the N360 had disrupted the production plans for the 1300, and so the design staff and factory personnel were temporarily diverted to that role).



C/G ordered a Honda 1300 77 Deluxe as soon at it was announced, but for the reasons mentioned above, delivery was delayed, and by the time it was finally delivered in mid-June, the editor in charge of road testing was seriously injured and hospitalized. We wanted to test the 1300 in earnest as soon as possible and report on it in full detail in the magazine, but we would like to apologize in advance for the six-month delay due to unavoidable circumstances.



The car used in this road test was an early production model that C/G purchased for long-term testing and has already driven about 12,000km. As you know, Honda products are subject to frequent design changes, especially in the first few months after mass production begins, so it's quite possible that there are some differences in design and behavior between the C/G 1300 and the latest model. I have tried to mention any differences I noticed in this report, but I would like to point out in advance that there may be some that I have overlooked (although according to the manufacturer, there are almost no changes in the specifications).



For those who are attracted to the Honda 1300, the biggest concern is probably speed, so let's start with that. The C/G 1300 recorded a top speed of just 160.0km/h and a 0-400m acceleration time of 18.5 seconds with two passengers and test equipment aboard (almost fully loaded). This is almost comparable to the Alfa Romeo 1300GT and Bluebird 1600 SSS, but it is still not as fast as the manufacturer claims (according to the catalog, top speed is 175km/h, and the 0-400m time is 17.5 seconds).



Like all Honda products, the power unit takes precedence over everything else, occupying a central position in the design of the 1300. As mentioned above, it is a forced air-cooled, SOHC four-cylinder engine, basically the same as the air-cooled F1 RA302, and uses a transversely mounted, front-wheel-drive layout pioneered by the BMC Mini. As usual, it is a high-revving, high-output type, its 100ps/7200rpm being about 30% higher than the average for a 1300cc class practical car (the maximum torque of 11.0kgm/4500rpm is about standard for this class).



Now, if you were to drive the Honda 1300 without any prior knowledge, you would never believe that it was air-cooled. The dry noise peculiar to air-cooled engines is not audible throughout the entire rev range, and the sound of the cooling fan does not suddenly increase at high revolutions (like with normal water-cooled engines). The Honda 1300 has brilliantly overturned the conventional wisdom that air-cooled engines are noisy. At 100km/h, the engine is only humming along lightly, and the wind noise around the windowsill is more noticeable. What is particularly noteworthy is that the noise level does not increase exponentially even at high speeds. Even at 120km/h, the engine noise level is exceptionally low, and it does not become significantly louder at 150km/h. The engine is well-balanced and has almost no vibrations over the entire range, which is hard to believe for a reciprocating four-cylinder engine. The rev counter is redlined from 7000-8000rpm, but it easily over-revs in first through third gear, and the engine is so smooth that the over-revving is not noticeable. The valve gear response is still perfect even at 8000rpm+. 



At Yatabe, I did five or six laps of the 5.5km circuit at full throttle, maintaining an actual speed of 160km/h (about 6800rpm, 174km/h on the speedometer!), and there was nothing wrong with the engine, and I did not feel any psychological stress. Therefore, the potential cruising speed on the highway is high, and if the law allowed, I could maintain 140km/h (about 5900rpm) for a long time. In this case, having a dry sump system gives me great psychological confidence.



This car is primarily a high-speed cruiser, but the compact exterior dimensions and sharp acceleration make it useful as a city runabout in crowded towns. The 4-speed gearbox has gear ratios that match the power characteristics well, the shift feel is excellent, and it can be given a good score overall in this kind of driving. If you push the engine up to 7000rpm, you can reach speeds of around 47, 84, and 123km/h in first, second, and third gears, respectively, and even if you push it up to 5000rpm at most in first and second gears, there is no car that can keep up with the Honda 1300 in a traffic light Grand Prix. 



On the other hand, this high-power engine is very tenacious even at low engine speeds, with a top-gear minimum speed of 40-45km/h (below 2000rpm), and it easily maintains 50km/h, accelerating without any hesitation when you step on the gas. The engine's flexibility and power reserve are clearly shown in the overtaking acceleration times in top gear, namely, the acceleration times for 40-80km/h, 60-100km/h, and 80-120km/h are almost the same, at 12.5 seconds, 11.9 seconds, and 12.2 seconds, respectively. The acceleration in top gear is still unabated even at 100km/h (about 4200rpm, close to the maximum torque point of 4500rpm), and it responds clearly when you step on the gas, finally slowing down after 130km/h. In conclusion, people who buy the Honda 1300 because they were attracted by speed will be more than satisfied.



However, high performance is not available for free. Fuel economy varies greatly depending on driving patterns, but in our case (70% city commuting, 30% on the highway), the end-of-month gas bill is more like that of a 1600cc GT than a 1300cc practical car. The overall average over a 1,400km test period was an unfavorable 7.5km/l. In the experience of the C/G 1300 77, the best fuel economy recorded was an average of 9.8km/l during the running-in period up to 1,000km. This is unprecedented. If you drive only in the city, the fuel efficiency may drop below 6km/l, and even under good conditions, such as a round trip to FISCO, the fuel efficiency was at most 8.5km/l. It is a small relief that regular gasoline can be used.



The poor fuel economy is related to the fact that it is air-cooled. It is said that air-cooled engines heat up quickly and cool down quickly, but this is not true in the case of Hondas; they tend to heat up slowly and cool down quickly. It is true that it warms up quickly in the summer (the same goes for water-cooled engines), and in fact it gets so hot that you can't even touch the hood. However, from the beginning of autumn, I started to notice the poor warm-up characteristics. Even after warming up the engine for a few minutes, it is easy to stall if you don't pull the choke and raise the engine speed to about 1500rpm, and it takes about five minutes of driving before you can fully release the choke. As I will explain later, the heater is also very slow to work, and it takes about 10 minutes of driving before it warms up slightly. 



The crucial disadvantage of air-cooled engines compared to water-cooled engines is that they cool down easily. In winter, if you leave the car parked for two hours, the engine will cool down completely and you will have to start the warm-up process all over again. One of the reasons for the poor fuel economy is that you often have to use the choke a lot. In this respect, water-cooled engines accumulate heat in the water, so there is little thermal change. Honda's PR says that air-cooled engines are hasse-free because they don't use water. However, modern water-cooled engines have sealed coolant systems that are service-free for two years, and as long as the thermostat is in good condition, they warm up quickly and maintain a constant temperature throughout the summer and winter. Therefore, their heaters also work well, so no matter how you look at it, water-cooled engines seem to have the advantage.



Another point I would like to make against Honda's insistence on air cooling is that the advantages of an air-cooled engine should be compactness and lightness, but in the case of the 1300, it is the opposite. First of all, it is absolutely heavy. The engine alone (including the dry sump oil tank) weighs about 180kg, which is at least 10kg heavier than a water-cooled engine plus its radiator in the same class, and it is by no means compact. It is certainly worthy of praise that it is so quiet that you would never think it was air-cooled, but the amount of weight, space, and cost that went into just making it quiet is a problem, and it has to be said that it has reduced the passenger compartment volume, which is the most important thing in a passenger car, upset the weight balance, and adversely affected the handling. Air cooling is a rather natural choice for a two-cylinder minicar like the N360, but it is difficult to understand the positive reason for adopting air cooling for a 1300cc engine (you may say, what about Porsche, but that is an expensive two-seater GT).



Now, let's change the topic and talk about handling and stability. With a weight distribution of 61.7%/38.3% when unladen, the Honda 1300 naturally has excellent directional stability. This is a big advantage when cruising on the highway (which is usually at high altitude, so there is almost always a crosswind). On the day that we went to Yatabe to test the Fairlady Z, there was a strong wind (with gusts of 10m/s at a time). The Fairlady Z was quite shaken at 150km/h, but when we drove the Honda 1300 that accompanied us to transport the test equipment, we found that even at 150km/h, it was hardly affected by the crosswind. However, unfortunately, the Honda 1300 is delicately affected by disturbances from the road surface. The steering wheel is easily affected not only by the rails of streetcars (which fortunately have become noticeably less common in Tokyo), but also by slight vertical ridges, and the tires tend to move around on their own. This naturally depends on the condition of the tire tread, especially at the edges. In the case of the Dunlop GS1 6.2S-13 tires that were fitted to our car, wear was very fast, with only 50% of the tread remaining after 5,000km, at which point the straight-line stability worsened noticeably.



Tires have a huge effect on the handling of any car, but in the case of the Honda 1300 it is extreme; the Honda has severe (I would say excessive) understeer, and in our opinion this excessive understeer should be attributed more to the tire performance than the suspension design. Simply put, the Dunlop GS1 6.2S-13 tires that came with the C/G 1300 77 (even though they were specially designed for this car, with an extremely low aspect ratio of 0.77) were completely unsuitable for the performance of this car. First of all, the abnormally rapid wear of the tires, with only 50% of the tread left after 5,000km, and the front tires completely bald after 10,000km, clearly shows this (though the manufacturer itself acknowledges that this wear rate is roughly standard for the 1300). The cornering power of the GS1 is low, and even when going around a street corner slowly at normal speeds, it makes a lot of squealing noise. The standard air pressure of 1.6kg/1.3kg (later revised to 1.7kg/1.4kg) is not so high as to cause problems, and with 2.0kg/1.8kg, the understeer is finally reduced to a level that can be tolerated during normal driving, and the ride comfort is not at all impaired. 



The suspension of the Honda 1300 series seems to be too focused on ride comfort. The suspension absorbs both small irregularities and large wavy bumps in the road, providing a very comfortable ride in both the front and rear seats. In this sense, the Honda 1300 is more of a passenger's car than a driver's car.



In our opinion, the suspension is too soft for a car with this speed potential. In addition, the basic layout, with a relatively high center of gravity and an absolutely narrow front track (1245mm, compared to 1300-1370mm for European front-wheel-drive cars of the same class) results in a large load transfer between the left and right tires when cornering, and a very large amount of body roll. Furthermore, rubber is used extensively in the suspension to soften impacts from the road surface. These various factors combine to make the understeer extremely strong up to the limit. It is good that the steering is very light even at parking speed and there is almost no kickback from the road surface, but the response is extremely slow. Even if you turn the wheel 45 degrees left and right at 100km/h, the direction does not change at all. Since there is no play at all in the rack and pinion steering gear, this is nothing but an indication of the low rigidity of the steering system and the large slip angle of the tires.



You need to be careful when going around tight corners at high speeds (this is true for any car). The most dangerous thing is to not fully understand that "front wheel drive cars go around corners while accelerating," go into a corner in second gear or under full throttle, get surprised by how much understeer there is, and release the throttle midway through the corner. In the case of the Honda, you need to turn the steering almost to full lock going into the hairpins at FISCO, but if you lift your foot off the throttle, it will suddenly spin to the inside. In this respect, the Subaru FF-1 is much less prone to this tendency, and its cornering posture is much more stable (but the ride is much less comfortable). 



As mentioned above, the tires on the C/G 1300 77 had almost completely worn down after about 12,000km, so after consulting with Honda, we replaced them with Dunlop GS1 6.2H-13 tires, which are standard equipment on the 99S model. On the label, these tires are the same as the 6.2H-13 tires on other 99s, but they can be distinguished by the lack of white ribbons on the sidewalls. Surprisingly, just by installing these tires, the handling of the C/G 1300 improved by about 50%, and about half our complaints about the handling were eliminated. First of all, the squealing in corners almost disappeared, the responsiveness improved dramatically, and cornering became much easier and safer. As for wear, we have only driven about 2,000km on these tires, so we cannot say anything definitive, but it seems that it is not much worse than the 6.2S-13s. The 6.2H-13 tires developed for the 99S are essentially the equivalent of six-ply tires, have a different cord angle, and have high lateral stiffness, especially in the sidewalls. For a car like the Honda 1300, where the absolute value of the front wheel load is large and the load transfer between the left and right tires is significant, radial tires with low lateral rigidity are particularly unsuitable. However, this six-ply-equivalent 6.2H does not impair the ride comfort at all. All things considered, this tire should be standard equipment on all Honda 1300s (the only drawback seems to be the high cost, but if it significantly reduces the possibility of accidents, then it is really cheap). In addition, the 4J x 13 wheels on this car seem to be too thin, so that the rims bend easily, and they are also not very rigid, so when going up a winding road such as Hakone, they deform in the corners and the wheel caps can come off.



Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have a large turning radius, and Honda and Subaru are at the top of the list in this respect, so unless the road is very wide, you won't feel like making a U-turn. 



Generally, it is difficult to design brakes for front wheel drive vehicles, but the Honda 1300's brakes are well matched to its high speed potential, and it can be given a passing grade. The front brakes are Girling type single cylinder (Annette type) discs with servos, and the rear brakes are drums with Sumitomo Kelsey-Hayes type pressure control valve. The pedal force is always light, and it provides strong and stable braking force even at high speeds. It showed a performance of 0.99g with a pedal force of 40kg from 50km/h. The amount of nose dive is large at first (it hardly sinks any further after the first touch of the pedal), so it is especially noticeable when the brakes are applied frequently at low speeds in town. C/G uses a harsh method called 0-100-0 to test brake fade. We accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, apply 0.5g braking until the car stops, immediately accelerate to 100km/h and brake again, and repeat this ten times while recording the change in pedal force required. In the case of the Honda 1300, the initial pressure was 10kg, but by the fourth stop it was 15kg, and by the sixth stop it was 20kg. However, it did not increase any further after that, and the braking effect itself was stable, so it can be judged that the brakes had sufficient fade resistance. The handbrake was in a good position behind the gear lever and worked on the rear wheels, so once you get used to it, you can make a Carson-style handbrake turn even on dry paved roads. 



The interior is not spacious for a 1300cc class vehicle. The driving position is generally good, except that the pedals are offset to the left due to the instrusion of the wheel arch (which is quite noticeable, at least at first). All of the instruments are easy to read. However, the design of the dashboard is somehow clumsy, and in the Deluxe model in particular, it is made of a cheap imitation wood grain that is not suitable for a mass-produced car. The 77 Deluxe's seats are made of hard vinyl leather, which can feel cold and hard in winter. The shape of the rear seats is good, and they are adequately comfortable, except for the short cushions. There are no intrusions from the wheel arches on either side in the rear, and the floor is flat, so three people can sit comfortably.  



The heater doesn't work very well. The Honda 1300 doesn't have an independent heater, but simply ducts air from the engine cooling fan at the tip of the crankshaft. The air-cooled engine is slow to warm up, and in cold weather the engine itself tends to overcool due to the wind while driving, so it doesn't work well as a heat source for the heater. At temperatures around 0°C, it takes 10 minutes for the heater to start working, and at least 20 minutes for the interior temperature to become moderate. At present, there is no optional front cover to prevent overcooling, and a heater for cold regions is still in the planning stages (using the heat from the exhaust pipe, not a combustion type). However, the worst thing is dealing with high temperature and humidity during the rainy season. There is no defroster independent of the heater, so if you try to defog the windshield, hot air comes out no matter what (it's very effective, but it's weak when the car is stopped and idling), and you can't do anything about how hot it is. However, the vents on both ends of the dash are effective for ventilation.



In conclusion, for better or worse, the overall design of the Honda 1300 is too heavily influenced by its high-power air-cooled engine. In a practical family sedan, the position that the engine occupies--its significance to the whole car--should not be so great.



<b><u>(Supplement: from March 1970 issue)</b></u>



In the February issue's Honda 1300 road test, I wrote that the heater did not work and that I wanted a front cover to prevent the engine from overcooling. I later discovered that this optional part is sold in cold regions and has finally become available in major cities recently. I installed it on our C/G 1300 right away, so I would like to report on it. It consists of a steel front cover (800 yen per side) that covers the left and right front grilles, and a plastic skirt cover (1000 yen) that covers the air intake behind the license plate. I first installed only the left and right grille covers on the C/G 1300, and sure enough, the engine temperature rose much higher and the warm-up became faster (even so, I pulled the choke out and kept the engine speed at 1500rpm for the first 10 minutes of driving). The heater became effective within about 10 minutes, and after 20 minutes, the interior became too hot at full throttle, so it was a great improvement in that sense. So I don't feel the need to install the skirt cover. However, the grille cover is removed easily because it is only hooked onto the grille with a simple claw. It dropped off our car once, so we have been fastening it with wires from behind. Incidentally, the exhaust heat heater for cold regions (Hokkaido only) is installed at the factory and is not available in other regions.
