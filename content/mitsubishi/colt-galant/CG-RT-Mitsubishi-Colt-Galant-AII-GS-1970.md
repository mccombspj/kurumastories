<b>Summary:</b> High performance version of the Galant, SOHC 1.5-liter engine, revs smoothly up to over 7000rpm, extremely responsive across the entire range, extremely good fuel economy, variable ratio steering with good response, handling generally excellent, but with standard tires it tends to oversteer early, good value for money.





<b><u>Road testing the Mitsubishi Colt Galant AII GS</b></u>







The Colt Galant, a strategic model with which Mitsubishi Heavy Industries dared to challenge the 1300-1600cc market, which is the most competitive not only in Japan but also internationally, got off to a good start with 6,400 units sold in December when it was released.

The Galant is available in two models, the AI with a 1.3-liter engine and the AII with a 1.5-liter engine, with a common four-door sedan body, and is further divided into seven variations with minor differences in specifications. The AII GS (Grand Sport) that we tested is the highest-performance sports sedan model, and is also the most expensive (711,000 yen).

<!--more-->To start with, we were deeply impressed by the high standard of the dynamics and overall refined behavior of the GS. Although the catalog data for domestic cars tends to be very optimistic based on our long experience, this Galant GS recorded almost all the figures listed in the catalog in our testing. For example, the top speed was easily 173.1km/h (175km/h in the catalog) over the 1km section of Yatabe, and the 0-400m acceleration was recorded at 17.2 seconds (16.9 seconds in the catalog) with almost a full load. Moreover, the constant speed fuel economy was amazingly good, 19.2km/l at 60km/h and 12.8km/l at 100km/h. Although these figures (other than fuel economy) do not have much practical meaning, especially in the case of passenger cars, they can at least be evidence of the small manufacturing variation in the product, and Mitsubishi's policy of publishing conservative figures in its catalog is very much appreciated.

The key to the high performance of the GS is undoubtedly its excellent engine, so let me start by explaining the specifications. The engine of the Galant is a newly developed SOHC unit that is completely different from the conventional Colt. While using a conventional layout, it has been ingeniously designed in every detail, resulting in extremely high performance (this seems to be a policy that has been followed not only in the engine, but throughout the entire design). The distinctive feature of the Galant engine is the highly efficient design of the intake and exhaust system. The SOHC cylinder head made of aluminum alloy has a nearly perfect hemispherical combustion chamber, with large intake and exhaust valves arranged at an angle of about 47 degrees. The intake port is slightly twisted relative to the combustion chamber, which induces a swirl and improves the combustion effect. The bore and stroke dimensions of the 1499cc AII engine feature a long stroke, at 75mm x 86mm, but this ratio was chosen primarily to make the base of the combustion chamber smaller than its depth, creating an ideal dome shape.

Both the power and torque are far above the standards of this class. The standard AII with a compression ratio of 9.0 and one Stromberg carburetor produces 95ps/6300rpm, while the GS, with a compression ratio of 10.0 and twin SU carburetors, produces 105ps/6700rpm. Torque is also strong, with the standard model producing 13.2kgm/4000rpm and the GS producing 13.4kgm/4800rpm.

The chassis design is quite ordinary, but the latest technology is still applied to the details. The body size is about the same as the Bluebird's, but the AII GS weighs only 855kg, 75kg lighter than the 1600 SSS. The front suspension is the MacPherson type, which has become standard for compact cars, but the lower arms are sturdy pressed wishbone types and there is a wide gap between the rubber bushings on the body mounting side, so there is little change in geometry, and you can expect accurate steering and effective blocking of road noise. The rear uses two equal-length leaf springs. 

The AII's brakes are common to all models, with a combination of 9" discs and 8" drums (with automatic adjustment), and of course, a dual-system circuit. AII models are fitted with 4J x 13 rims and 6.15-13 low-profile tires.

According to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the suspension settings are the same for all Galant models. However, in our experience, there are significant differences between the AII GS we tested and the AI Custom we purchased for our long-term test. The manufacturer explains that this is due to the difference in tires (the GS we tested had Bridgestone Skyway HHT Nylon 4PR tires, while the C/G AI Custom had Yokohama Nylon 4PRs, but at least one other difference is that the GS is 15mm lower in ride height.

The first thing you notice when you get on the road is that the engine revs up to high rpm with amazing smoothness. On the rev counter, 6400-6750rpm is the yellow zone, and 6750-8000rpm is the red zone, but in low gears it can easily rev up to over 7000rpm. From idling at 800rpm to a practical maximum of over 7000rpm, it is exceptionally smooth for a four-cylinder engine, and no Japanese six-cylinder engine can match it. The 105ps is enough for a vehicle weighing 855kg, and because of the flat torque characteristics, you can run quietly and quickly in the city without having to rev above 2500rpm. For the same reason, it always responds quickly to the throttle in any gear, but if we had to say, the most useful range is around 3000 to 6500rpm. In particular, the engine's power output at high speeds above 5000rpm is excellent, far surpassing the AI with a single carburetor that was tested at the same time (although as mentioned in the AI test report, it revs very well for a 1300cc practical model). 

The engine's mechanical noise is low, and the cooling fan has a fluid coupling, so fan noise is also low (the AI's fan is directly connected, so it revs at high speeds and sounds somewhat harsh). However, it is unfortunate that the exhaust system resonance is quite strong inside the cabin, mainly at 3500rpm. This corresponds to around 90-100km/h in top gear, which is the usual speed that is used for long periods of time on the highway.

The gear ratios are set appropriately for the power. The top speed test was conducted by continuously driving at full throttle on the 5.5km circuit at Yatabe, measuring the straight 1km section and the average speed for a full lap of the circuit. The GS recorded an average of 173.1km/h on the 1km section in ideal windless conditions. The engine speed was about 6200rpm, 200pm below the yellow zone, and it still felt relatively unstressed. In Japan, the top speed has little practical meaning, but in foreign markets where the Galant will soon be released, it is common to drive flat-out for hours on end. Our impression is that the GS's practical high-speed cruising speed is high, and it will be able to maintain 160km/h for a long time. The speedometer of our test car was rather pessimistic. For example, the actual speed was 104km/h at an indicated 100km/h, and 167km/h at 160kmh, so high-speed drivers should be careful.

The appropriate gear ratio spacing of the 4-speed gearbox was especially evident during acceleration tests. That is, when we accelerated up to 7000rpm and shifted up, the engine speed dropped to about 5000rpm (maximum torque is at 4800rpm), putting it in the best position for full acceleration in the next gear. If you push the engine up to 6750rpm, where the red zone begins, the car will reach about 140km/h in third gear, making it the perfect gear for quick overtaking, especially on the highway.

To demonstrate the power reserve, the top gear overtaking acceleration data shows that the 40-80km/h, 60-100km/h, and 80-120km/h times are 9.7 seconds, 9.4 seconds, and 10.7 seconds, respectively, which is close to the Corona Mark II GSS, which has a much better power-to-weight ratio (7.5kg/ps, compared to the GS's 8.1kg/ps).

Gear shifting feels good, and operation of the lever is light and sure. The third gear synchro on the test car was weak, and the gearbox shaft vibrated abnormally above 5000rpm, which was annoying. However, the C/G AI Custom and other Galants I have tested previously had no such problems, and the synchro was very strong, so we believe this was a problem caused by the test vehicle (which had already traveled over 6,500km) being treated extremely harshly.

The clutch is light with an appropriate stroke, and even when released roughly from high revolutions, as in the acceleration tests or the high-speed test, there is very little slippage and it connects smoothly.

In short, despite its high performance, the Galant AII GS is very easy to drive even for complete beginners driving around town for the first time.

One morning during testing, it was -6Â°C, and I had to press the starter a couple of times to get the engine to start. However, because the intake manifold is pre-heated with hot water, it warms up extremely quickly. After starting, I let it warm up for about a minute, released the choke, and started driving, and it immediately started to pull smoothly (although it took 12 to 13 minutes for the water temperature needle to reach the normal temperature).

The pleasant surprise about the GS was that the high performance was combined with extremely good fuel economy. The constant speed fuel economy (recorded by driving at a constant speed for 1km) was, for example, 20.8km/l at 40km/h in top gear, and 16.6km/l at 80km/h.,which are incredible values, even better than the C/G AI Custom that was tested at the same time (the AI recorded 17.8km/l and 14.7km/l at the same speeds). The possible reasons for this are that the AII has higher gearing and that the C/G AI has only been driven 2,000km, while the AII's engine was well run-in at 6,500km, so friction in each part is likely to be low. However, in actual driving conditions where acceleration and deceleration are frequent, the fuel economy is not as good as it is at a constant speed, and the AI is more economical. The average fuel economy over a test distance of about 440km (including about 200km at the Yatabe test course) driven under exactly the same conditions was 9.2km/l for the AI, and 8.2km/l for the AII GS. The fuel tank is 45 liters, so at 100km/h on the highway, you can go at least 500km without refueling. In short, the AII GS's fuel economy is extremely economical considering its high performance.

The GS's brakes are adequate for the performance of the car. A brake force of 0.95g was obtained with 35kg of pedal pressure, so pedal force is normal and there was no need for a servo. There was little nose dive. In the 0-100-0 fade test, the pedal presure increased from 20kg at the beginning to 27kg on the seventh stop, and the braking effect became a little rough, but even on the tenth stop the pedal pressure was still 30kg, so it can be said that the brakes have adequate fade resistance. The relative position of the brake and throttle pedal is suitable for heel-and-toeing.

The handling is at quite a high level, despite the ordinary suspension. The variable ratio (15.6:1 when going straight, 18.2:1 when approaching full lock) ball-and-nut steering is soft and natural, with moderate weight. The GS's response is much sharper than the AI's, but it is not particularly sensitive. The steering gear ratio is the same, so this is mainly due to the difference in tires. The tires on the test car, Bridgestone Skyway Hs, are quite stiff and feel highly rigid laterally, even though they are four-ply (4PR). The steering is very light at normal speeds, and the car follows the steering obediently. Roll angles are unusually small for a relatively tall car. However, the adhesion of this tire is not good, and the rear wheels break traction unexpectedly early, turning to oversteer. At first, it is a little surprising because the small roll angles do not suggest the limit is near. But once you get used to it, you can consciously use the throttle to slide the tail and make tight turns. We tried rally-style driving on a winding, rough forest road in the mountains, and the GS was able to maintain a fairly high speed even with the standard suspension. Braking hard before the corner, and using the steering and throttle to swing the tail around, it was possible to point the car decisively into the next corner. 

We continued this 7-8km run of accelerating at full power down the short straights leading to the corners, then braking hard again, and the quick steering and reliable brakes were a great asset in this situation. The AI Custom that accompanied us was obviously not suited to this type of driving, as the steering was too strong and the drum brakes were a little unreliable. The AII GS has the potential to be a perfect rally car if the suspension was stiffer and radial tires were installed, as it has enough power as it is.

If I had one request regarding the suspension, it would be to add a torque rod to the rear. Because the suspension is relatively soft and the engine is powerful, the rear axle tends to move wildly when accelerating suddenly during acceleration tests. 

The ride quality is very different between the front and rear seats. The front seats are large and well-padded, so they are very comfortable to ride in on all road surfaces, and I didn't get tired even after driving for nearly ten hours a day. The front seats of the GS in particular offer better lateral support than those in the AI. However, while the rear seats are comfortable in terms of size, the rear dampers are firm, so they jostle you strongly on rough roads.

The interior has many things in common with the AI, so I will leave the details to the AI test report and focus on the unique features of the AII GS. The driving position is very good, and the wood-rimmed steering wheel can be adjusted up and down by about 50mm, a feature unique to the Galant, so it can be adjusted to suit the preferences of drivers of all sizes. The only thing I'm not happy about with the controls is that the horn button is located in the center of the steering wheel, which means that when driving in a rally-like manner as described above, you can't sound the horn without taking your hands off the steering wheel rim, which is very inconvenient. (In this respect, the AI Custom, which has the horn buttons embedded in the spokes, is better).

Overall, the AII GS is a good everyday vehicle suitable for hard, sporty driving, and almost completely satisfies the needs of the family man who wants everything in one car. I'd say it's the best value for money in this class.
