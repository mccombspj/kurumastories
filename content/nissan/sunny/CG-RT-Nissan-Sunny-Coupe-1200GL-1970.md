<b><u>Road testing the Sunny Coupe 1200GL</b></u>





The Sunny 1200, which was released on January 6th, was the first of Nissan's 1970.5 models. It is a size larger than the previous Sunny 1000 (or two sizes larger, according to the manufacturer's PR), and is equipped with a newly designed five-bearing, 1171cc, 68ps engine, with a richer interior and exterior, making it a significantly upgraded model. 



Apart from the engine, the major differences from the Sunny 1000 are that the front suspension was changed from a transverse leaf spring and double wishbone type to a strut type like the Bluebird, and that disc brakes were finally installed (only on the top-of-the-line GL model). From the start, the car was available as a two or four-door sedan, a coupe, and even a van, and a variety of transmissions could be selected from a 3-speed column shift, to a 4-speed floor shift, to Nissan's full automatic (this was probably a lesson learned from the bitter experience of the Sunny 1000, which was very unpopular when it was released, when it was only available as a two-door sedan with a 3-speed column shift). 



The model we tested here is the Coupe GL (590,000 yen) with a 4-speed floor shift. The difference between the coupe and the sedan is mainly in the body, and the mechanical parts are completely the same. The engine tuning was different between the sedan (56ps) and the coupe (60ps) in the previous Sunny, but in the new Sunny, both have the same output of 68ps/6000rpm. The weight has increased by 25kg to 700kg (manufacturer's published value), but the increase in power is even greater, with the power-to-weight ratio improving from 11.3kg/ps in the 1000 Coupe to 10.3kg/ps in the 1200 Coupe.



In short, the new 1200 is a big improvement over the old 1000 in almost every respect. One of the most important improvements is, of course, the engine. Its capacity is now 1171cc (still oversquare, with a bore and stroke of 73mm x 70mm), with a stroke increase of 11m over the previous 988cc unit, and the crankshaft is now a five-bearing type. Power is 68ps/6000rpm, and torque is 9.7kgm/3600rpm. 



The Sunny 1000's engine is well known for being very light and revving up to high revolutions easily, despite being a completely ordinary OHV unit, but this feeling is even stronger in the new 1200. We set the rev limit at 6500rpm as dictated by common sense (it is strange that the Coupe GL, which is fully equipped with accessories, does not come with a rev counter; we installed an electronic rev counter for the test), but during acceleration tests, it was easy for the engine to over-rev in first and second gears. The valve gear has a very light inertia feeling, and the valve response is exceptionally good for an OHV engine, with no sign of bounce even at 7000rpm. The balancing is very good throughout the entire rev range, and it's hard to believe that it's an OHV inline four-cylinder. It would be no disrespect to say that this Sunny 1200 is unusual among the generally rough Nissan engines. 



The engine noise level is also much lower than that of the Sunny 1000. This is no doubt due in part to the increased rigidity of the crank due to the five bearings, but another factor is that the cooling fan has been changed from steel plate, which is prone to resonance, to synthetic resin. In any case, it is an engine that can be revved up without any psychological stress.



The reason why the 1000 is generally considered to be a noisy car is because the gearing is short, keeping the revs high. However, the 1200's increased torque makes it easier to pull taller gearing. In other words, the speed per 1000rpm in top gear has significantly increased from 22.8km/h for the 1000 to 26.4km/h in the 1200 (normally, the standard for 1200cc class cars is 23-24km/h, and Japanese-made cars are generally lower in order to emphasize acceleration at low speeds). This gear ratio setting was found to be just right for the weight and power output of the car in our tests.



The catalog top speed of the Sunny 1200 (both sedan and coupe) is listed as 150km/h (the 1000 coupe was 140km/h), and the test car recorded a consistent 148.8km/h at Yatabe. This is the average for the 1km straight, but the lap average for the 5.5km circuit was 147.8km/h, which is great performance for a 1.2-liter OHV engine. This is close to the ideal gearing setting for a practical car, and it is very easy to reach top speed, reaching 137km/h (in about 35 seconds) at the 1km mark from a standing start, and then reaching top speed in about another 30 seconds. The speedometer in our test car was very lenient, with the needle far off the 160km/h scale when actual speed was 148km/h.



The gearbox is another big attraction of the Sunny. The synchromesh is absolutely unbeatable, and the shift throws are short and reliable. Due to the free-revving engine and the high gearing, first, second and third gears can reach 45, 80, and 125km/h at 6500rpm, which is the practical maximum, and the absolute limit is about 10% higher than that. There is almost no gear noise, but the gear lever vibrates a little when the revs exceed 5000rpm. The clutch has a moderate stroke and engages smoothly, but the pedal on the test car required a lot of pressure and made an abnormal noise, probably due to friction in the operating cable.



Acceleration performance is also top class for a 1200cc practical car. 0-400m was recorded in 18.5 seconds with a load equivalent to three passengers (17.9 seconds with two passengers, according to the catalog). The power characteristics are of the favorable "flat torque" type, and linear acceleration is obtained by stepping on the gas at almost any range, in any gear. Even in top gear, if you step on the gas gently from 30km/h, you can accelerate smoothly without knocking. Despite the compression ratio of 9.0, regular gasoline is sufficient. 



The difference in power at high speeds is absolutely superior to the old Sunny 1000. For example, the quick acceleration from 80, 100, or 120km/h in top gear is in a different league from the 1000, and on the highway, you can overtake and climb hills in top gear.The overall noise level is significantly lower than the 1000, and when driving at around 60-80km/h, it is so quiet that you wouldn't think it was only a 1200cc engine. However, it is unfortunate that there is a loud exhaust resonance in the mid-range, around 4000rpm, which corresponds to the 100km/h cruising speed (about 3800rpm) which is most common on the highway. 



Due to its tall gearing characteristics, the Sunny naturally lends itself to high cruising speeds, and if the law allows it, it is not impossible to maintain a cruising speed of 120-130km/h for extended periods. The wind noise from the body is exceptionally low, but noise from the road is quite loud. One of the reasons for this is that the coupe does not have a bulkhead (which would be an effective soundproofing wall) between the trunk and the passenger compartment, so the trunk can be accessed by folding down the rear seatbacks.



Even in the early morning when the temperature was below freezing, the engine always started immediately when I pulled the (manual) choke. Even when I released the choke almost immediately, it idled smoothly at 800rpm, and once I started driving, it accelerated immediately without hesitation. 



I was a little worried that the mixture might be on the rich side, but judging from the generally very good fuel economy, this doesn't seem to be the case. The overall average over 512km, including about 200km of constant-speed testing at Yatabe, was 11.5km/l, and even in stop-and-go driving in urban areas, it is unlikely to fall below 10km/l. It is especially good when cruising on the highway, where it is certain to achieve more than 13km/l, so if you fill up the 38-liter tank with regular gasoline, you can travel nearly 500km without refueling. For a car like the Sunny Coupe, which is primarily aimed at young owners (who inevitably have light pockets), this fuel economy will be seen as a great advantage.



The biggest improvement in the Sunny's chassis is undoubtedly the inclusion of disc brakes (Arnett type, made by Girling Tokico) for the first time. The drum brakes on the previous Sunny 1000 were completely inadequate for the car's dynamic performance. When I tested that car, even a speed of just 80km/h, the brakes didn't seem to work at all when I stepped on them. The 1200's disc brakes don't have a servo, so they require a relatively large amount of force given the weight of the car (32kg of pedal force to obtain 0.95 of braking force), but they are incredibly powerful compared to drum brakes, so they can be used safely at high speeds. In the 0-100-0 fade test, the initial force of 21kg increased to 33kg by the sixth stop, and there was a burning smell, but the brakes remained stable until the last (tenth) stop, so it can be said that the brakes have reasonable fade resistance. The handbrake on the floor is exceptionally powerful, providing 0.3g of braking force from 50km/h.



The steering is always extremely light and accurate enough that it is not a problem in everyday use. It turns from lock to lock in three turns of the wheel, while allowing about 5cm of free play at the rim. The minimum turning radius is 4.1m, making it extremely maneuverable. In fact, there is probably no other car that is easier to turn in a tight space than the Sunny. On good roads, the straight-line stability is excellent, so much so that you can let go of the wheel at top speed (there was almost no wind on the test day), but on uneven roads, such as undulating paved roads, the straight-line stability is easily disturbed. It seems to be bump steer. 



The handling is not much different from the previous Sunny 1000, which means it is average. The Sunny 1000 rolls to relatively large angles when cornering, and the inside rear wheel spins easily, which tends to induce tail slide. The new 1200, unfortunately, inherits this same characteristic. The rear wheel adhesion is low, so if you power around a tight corner in second gear, the inside wheel spins easily, and if you try to accelerate in second gear on a gravel road, both wheels spin and directional stability is disturbed. In short, the tail feels very light. However, the tail slide starts gradually and is of a predictable nature, so Sunny drivers will instinctively learn to correct it with quick steering correction. The Yokohama 6.00-12 tires on the test car had poor grip even on dry concrete and slid quite easily. The wheel rims have been widened from 3.5J to 4J. 



One of the major improvements in the 1200 is the ride comfort. It has become softer in general, and the improvement is particularly noticeable on rough roads. There are no more direct shocks like in the previous model, and even though it is a light car, there is a certain sense of weight to it. The improvement in ride quality is also due in part to the greatly improved interior comfort. The body has become two sizes larger, and this is best felt as the increased interior width. Previously, the Sunny's interior was notorious for being cheap-looking and poorly finished, but the 1200 has made great improvements in this regard as well. First of all, the seats in the GL are well finished. with soft tricot fabric in the center of the cushions, and are generous in size, with good lateral support. The driving position is generally good although some people have suggested that the seats be a little lower. The rear seats are more spacious than those of a typical coupe, but when the front seats are slid all the way back (as any driver over 175cm tall would do), the rear passenger's knees touch the front seatbacks, and the headroom is also very limited. However, if the front seats are moved forward one notch, the rear passenger can sit comfortably for a long time. The cushion in the center of the rear seats is thin due to the driveshaft tunnel, and it is impossible to bear for a long time.



The GL is also well equipped with accessories, and the new powerful ventilation system is extremely useful (there was no effective ventilation other than opening the windows in the previous 1000). This can also be linked to the heater, so even in winter you can create the ideal conditions of warming your feet and cooling your face with fresh air. 



A traditional feature of the Sunny Coupe is that the rear seat backrest can be folded foward to connect with the rear luggage compartment, creating a spacious, flat floor. It is certainly convenient to be able to load and unload long objects, such as skis or guitars, which seem to be inseparable from the young generation these days, from the rear of the car. However, this is only possible for thin objects. The opening of the Sunny Coupe's trunk is extremely narrow, and bulky items cannot be loaded through it. For example, 43 x 41 x 37cm square box that the C/G test group always uses to store our test equipment cannot be loaded through here, and the front seat backrest does not fold forward far enough, making it quite difficult to load through the doors. The real drawback to this arrangement is that since there is no proper trunk, the luggage inside the car is visible from the outside, which can be worrying, and it is difficult to find a place to put cargo that may soil the interior. Also, dust is easily drawn in through the rear quarter window, so luggage is more likely to get dirty than in a proper enclosed trunk. Therefore, it would be more practical in all respects to have a partition between the passenger compartment and a separate trunk, even if it was small.



Owners of the current Sunny 1000 Coupe will find the new 1200 Coupe GL to be a great improvement in almost every respect. With excellent economy and a low price of 590,000 yen, the Sunny 1200 Coupe GL is sure to become the first choice for many young people looking for a sporty coupe.
