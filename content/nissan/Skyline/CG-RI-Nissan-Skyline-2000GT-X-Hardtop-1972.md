<b><u>Road testing the Skyline 2000GT-X Hardtop</b></u>


The top-of-the-line model of the Skyline series, which now seems to have become Nissan's cash cow (apart from the GT-R, which has a completely different character), is the 2000GT-X Hardtop, which was added to the lineup in the fall of 1971. Just recently, Nissan also released a GT-X version of the four-door 2000GT sedan. 

The GT-X is a model with a mildly tuned version of the GT's six-cylinder 1998cc engine, adding twin SU carburetors while keeping the compression ratio unchanged, and it comes standard with a car stereo and seats with tricot inserts. It is the first in the GT series to offer a 5-speed gearbox with Porsche synchro (as an option, costing 40,000 yen more), and the GT-X's Tokyo price is 98,000 yen higher than the standard GT for the Hardtop, and 75,000 yen higher for the sedan, at 993,000 yen and 935,000 yen, respectively. A 3-speed automatic transmission is available on both GT-Xs and can be added for 55,000 yen.

The L20 engine is the same as in the Cedric GX and base Fairlady Z, and the premium gasoline version has a maximum output of 130ps/6000rpm and a maximum torque of 17.5kgm/4400rpm (the regular gasoline version produces 125ps/6000rpm and 17/0kgm/4400rpm), which is only 10ps and 0.5kgm more than the standard, single carburetor 2000GT. The optional 5-speed gearbox is based on that of the GT-R, with only the first and second gear ratios revised to be shorter, and of course fifth is an overdrive gear. The final drive ratio remains unchanged at 3.90, so the overall ratio is significantly higher than the GT's. The gear ratios for the GT-X are 3.321 / 2.077 / 1.308 / 1.000 / 0.864, while those of the 4-speed GT are 3.592 / 2.246 / 1.415 / 1.000. 

Having missed out on testing the 2000GT-X Hardtop at the time of its release, we immediately requested for Nissan to send us a sedan GT-X to test the combination of the SU twin-carb engine and the 5-speed gearbox in this newest model. However, Nissan's PR department advised that only a hardtop 2000GT-X was available, and we headed to Hakone in the hardtop, knowing that our report on it would be a little late. The test car, which had been driven about 13,000km, was a premium gasoline model, and fortunately had the optional 5-speed gearbox. The tires were the optional Bridgestone Radial 11s, in size 165SR-14.

In our previous test of the Skyline Hardtop 2000GT, we noted that its single-carburetor engine easily revved up to over 7000rpm, had sufficient flexibility even at low speeds, and was quiet. These characteristics are inherited in the GT-X. In fact, despite the tall gear ratio, the engine is tenacious at low speeds in the city, and even if you can't quite use fifth gear, you can get enough acceleration in fourth gear from 1000rpm, or just under 40km/h, to keep up with the flow of traffic. Or, if you prefer a sportier driving style, you can keep it in first and second gears (which can reliably reach speeds of over 80km/h) in the city, making it a wolf in sheep's clothing.

The performance seemed adequate in the city, but once we got on the highway and started cruising at high speed, we were a little disappointed. Cruising at a constant speed was no problem, but when overtaking at around 100km/h, it just didn't have the expected punch. Cruising at 100km/h corresponds to 2800rpm in fifth gear, and 3200rpm in fourth gear, so it's only natural that acceleration is a little sluggish from such low revs. But even when shifting down to third gear, which raises the engine speed to 4200rpm, just shy of the power peak, the feeling of acceleration was not much different, and it still seemed a little sluggish. 

At first we thought it might be because the gear ratios of third, fourth, and fifth gear were close together, but it soon became clear that the engine was not producing the power listed in the catalog. It took more than five minutes to warm up (and didn't accelerate smoothly until it reached its normal temperature), and the power dropped off drastically from around 5500rpm despite having twin carburetors. As you might guess, the main reason is that the carburetors are set as lean as possible to comply with exhaust gas regulations, and our honest impression was that the maximum output was just under 100ps. 

However, aside from this point, the GT-X can be said to be a comfortable highway cruiser. It has excellent straight-line stability up to 160km/h, and even when using fourth and sometimes third gear instead of fifth, the noise level at high speeds is far below that of most domestic cars. It also has sufficient resistance to crosswinds. Especially within the legal maximum speed range, it is possible to drive with complete peace of mind. Even the speedometer is relaxed, indicating 100km/h at an actual speed of 95.5km/h.

On the mountain roads of Hakone, however, the tall gear ratios and the apparent shortage of power conspire to make the car feel even more sluggish. In particular, in second and third gears, which are used frequently in this type of driving, the car lacks punch for overtaking (this is largely due to the psychological effect of the engine not having the sharpness that is characteristic of twin carburetors), so it was necessary to use one gear lower than usual. A 5-speed gearbox that adds an overdrive on top of the standard 4-speed gearbox's ratios would be better for this car (and this level of power). 

Ironically, the GT-X's suspension has been strengthened to match the performance, which ended up being underwleming, and as a result, the car has a relatively high level of maneuverability. The steering has about 10cm of play when going straight, so it requires an exaggerated movement at turn-in, but once into the corner, the front wheels respond smoothly and obediently. Although the steering keeps the driver's hands quite busy due to the large-diameter wheel, it is always light. In other words, it is neither sluggish nor overly sensitive, making it suitable for drivers of average skill level. 

The same goes for the GT-X's cornering characteristics. It maintains stable understeer in turns, and the degree of understeer does not increase much even when the speed is increased, making it easy to control. It does not have enough power to induce rear wheel breakaway, and control inputs during cornering, such as braking, have little effect on the car's cornering attitude, so it can be said to be extremely safe. However, if there is a bump mid-corner, care must be taken as the wheels have a tendency to jump around quite a bit. 

The Bridgestone Radial 11 tires on the test car had relatively poor adhesion, but were a good match for the car's maneuverability and power. Even though we used the specified high-speed tire pressures (2.0/2.1kg) on the day of the test, they still squealed when cornering at low speeds, but control was easier than with tires that bite well and break away suddenly. The front disc and rear drum brakes are also one of the car's good points. The discs squeaked a lot at low speeds, but the pedal was always light and they worked reliably from any speed.

The ride is excellent regardless of speed or road surface thanks to the long wheelbase, moderately firm suspension, and good seats. However, the hardtop's rear seats have 70mm less legroom than the sedan, and you have to be prepared for slightly larger jolts from below. 

Finally, in terms of fuel economy, our 350km test drive, including a round trip to Hakone on the Tomei Expressway and stop-and-go driving in the city, resulted in 7.9km/l, the best of any Skyline in the 2000GT series tested by C/G to date. This is partly due to the effect of using fourth and fifth gears half-and-half while driving on the Tomei Expressway, but it is more likely due to the lean fuel mixture. Even so, the 50-liter fuel tank shared with the 1500/1800 series is insufficient for a long-distance touring car. Oil consumption was zero during the test period.

In conclusion, the GT-X's 10ps increase over the standard 2000GT (120ps) is offset by the taller gear ratios, and its acceleration feels somewhat slower. The 5-speed is good for those who want quiet and refined high-speed driving, but for those who want a sporty driving style, the standard 4-speed gearbox would be more suitable.
