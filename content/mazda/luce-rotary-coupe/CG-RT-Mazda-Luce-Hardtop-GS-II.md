<b><u>Road testing the Luce Hardtop GS II</b></u>















The new Mazda Luce series was just announced last October, and for this report, we tested the top-performance hardtop GSII over a distance of about 850km. We had already had the opportunity to test drive this model for a short time immediately after its announcement, and were particularly impressed by its handling, which was far superior to that of previous Mazda mass-market cars. In the road test in last month's issue, we covered the sedan GR AP model, which is equipped with a thermal reactor for exhaust emission control, which is currently a hot topic. Contrary to what you might imagine from the name "clean engine," the engine in that car produces effective power, and the excellent automatic transmission is well matched to it. In addition, one thing that made a strong impression was the well-balanced chassis which is fitted with ordinary 6.45-13-4PR bias-ply tires on 5J x 13-inch wheels (which are still on the wide side for a Japanese passenger car). 



Since even the standard sedan model was above the standard of family cars, we were extremely interested in, and had high expectations for, the sporty version of the series, which has rims that are wider by another half inch, unusually fat tires called B70-13-4PR (equivalent to 195/70-13 in radial terms) that were especially developed for the Luce, and two sturdy torque rods added to the rear suspension (rigid axle with semi-elliptical leaf springs). The test car was the hottest model in the catalog, equipped with a 573cc x 2-rotor 130ps rotary engine without a thermal reactor and a manual 5-speed gearbox. It cost 1,040,000 yen with the optional power windows (30,000 yen). A Custom (a sporty version of the standard four-door sedan) and GRII, both with a reactor-equipped AP engine with 5 fewer horsepower, and a choice of automatic or manual transmission, are also available with this chassis.



Let us start by looking at the results of the tests on maneuverability, which was our biggest focus of interest. We were very disappointed in this regard. The potential of the chassis is extremely insufficient to drive this car actively, and it is generally in the "dull" category, not going much further than conventional domestic sports cars (most of which have chassis that cannot keep up with their engines). If the swift horse that galloped through the mountain roads of Izu when it was first announced (see C/G, No. 139) was also a Luce GSII, then the car we drove for this test, which was also a GSII, should be exactly the same, at least according to the specs on paper. But when we actually drove it, it behaved in a way that made us think it was a completely different car. The difference between the two cars goes far beyond the so-called degree of difference, such as differences caused by wear in each part due to amount of mileage, or the allowable production variation that is occurs in mass-produced cars. 



The first GSII we drove, which we highly praised, was without a doubt the best-handling car we have experienced among Japanese cars. Despite its conventional chassis layout, its handling characteristics were virtually neutral, and even in high-speed cornering, the car could turn as if it were following rails, without any correction of the steering angle once applied, even under full power in third gear. The steering was quite heavy, but there was almost no elastic play near the straight-ahead, and while it was moderately sensitive, it was at a level that could even be called "textbook" for sports car steering, almost completely shutting out kickack from the road surface, despite the tires having high lateral rigidity. It can be said that this maneuverability was particularly outstanding in that it was combined with a very high level of ride comfort as a passenger car. 



However, the GSII that was the subject of this second test, which included detailed measurements at Yatabe, had almost only one thing in common with the previous test vehicle, which was an excellent and solid ride regardless of the road surface. In particular, the steering was surprisingly insensitive, and not only was it not very precise overall, but there was also a lot of elastic play when going straight (including pure mechanical play), with a "dead zone" of more than 10cm at the wheel rim. In fact, even if you turn the steering wheel violently to the left and right by about 45 degrees while driving straight at 100km/h, the car does not respond much. Therefore, for example, when driving on a highway with a strong crosswind, you have to correct your course in anticipation of the dead zone, so you will inevitably have to use extra concentration until you get used to it.  



The car's cornering balance is also extremely strong understeer from start to finish. Even with the B70-13 bias-ply tires (the test car was equipped with Bridgestone Skyway Deluxe), which are said to provide high cornering power between that of 175SR-13 and 195SR-13 radials of average design, it becomes difficult to maintain the predicted line unless you continue to increase the angle of the steering wheel, which is already exaggerated at the entrance to the corner, further toward the inside. In addition, the steering force is extremely heavy, and your arms will get tired if you drive fast on a winding road. The Mazda Capella does not show particularly satisfactory handling, even in the Coupe GSII, which has the highest chassis tuning, and the Luce GSII is almost at the same level. Considering the difference in tires (the Capella GSII is fitted with 165S-13), the Luce may actually be inferior. The strength of the understeer can be understood by saying that when you ease off the throttle when cornering, the nose rolls in just like a powerful FWD car. In addition, the roll angles are large, and in tight corners, the inside rear wheel tends to lift up, causing it to spin violently, and the speed drops drastically.



We don't know exactly what caused this difference, but the manufacturer's official comment was that there should be no difference in the details between the car we drove before and the one we drove this time. It would be fortunate if the standard suspension had simply been installed by mistake. We were impressed by the handling of the Luce in the past, and we said that it would be good if the mass-produced model had the same specificatiaons, but it turns out that those hopes have not been met.



Of the 573cc x 2 12A-type engines that belong to the same family as the Capella, the GSII type (called Type 3) without the thermal reactor produces a maximum output of 130ps/7000rpm, and a maximum torque of 16.5kgm/4000rpm, the highest power of any commercially available Toyo Kogyo rotary engine to date. This output is sufficient for the car's weight of 1035kg, and it is not at all unpleasant for any driving style, but since a special emissions controller is not installed, the carburetor setting is as lean as possible to prevent CO2 emissions (on the other hand, in the case of a reactor-equipped engine, the mixture is supplied twice as rich as normal to promote the action of the reactor), and as a result, the engine overall lacks a strong punch, and the engine is slow to accelerate in the high-speed range above 5000rpm. 



Unfortunately, the engine of the test car was not in perfect condition, and the weakening of the high-speed range was particularly noticeable during the top speed test.  It is quite unusual for a Japanese-made car of this kind, but the Luce GSII's top speed is reached not in the overdrive fifth gear (0.862), but in the direct fourth gear. In a flying kilometer test, the car recorded a top speed of 177.4km/h (6900rpm, 190km/h as listed in the catalog and on the speedometer), while in fifth gear, it was somewhat slower at 174.1km/h (about 5600rpm, 181km/h on the speedometer). Since the reduction ratio is smaller and the driving force is reduced, the speed reduces accordingly. If the car is left in fifth gear, the needle on the rev counter drops to 5300rpm as soon as it enters a headwind zone. However, if the engine had been in perfect condition, it would have certainly exceeded 180km/h, because the Capella GSII, which has almost the same gearing and 13-inch wheels, recorded 181.8km/h in fifth gear on a 1km straight section during the C/G test at Yatabe. The power-to-weight ratios are also very close, with the Luce at 7.96kg/ps and the Capella at 7.84kg/ps. 



Starting acceleration and overtaking acceleration are also slightly slower than the Capella that C/G ran at Yatabe. This may be influenced by the maintenance conditions at the time, but more likely it is due to Toyo Kogyo's policy on tuning rotary engines. With each new model, the company's rotary engines have become slightly smoother and more flexible. In fact, in the early Capellas, even gathering overtaking data from 20-60km/h in fourth gear was completely impossible, as the engine suffered a kind of knock and could not accelerate. However, improvements have been made to make it easier to handle by giving it effective torque that allows it to run smoothly even at low speeds. And as a result, the frenzy of the rotary engine has faded away. 



The 5-speed gearbox is the same as that installed in the Capella and Savanna GT, with the fifth gear position on the upper right of the H-shaped pattern. Therefore, like those cars, there are no complaints about the shift feel, synchronizer capacity, or durability. The test car, which must have been roughly handled for about 3,000km already, always made a loud gear noise when shifting quickly, such as in the acceleration tests. This is not an extreme condition, and even the 4-speed type of the C/G Savanna, which is only driven in a normal everyday manner, does not have a very strong synchronizer. Still, it may be best to choose a model with a JATCO automatic transmission. It is 35,000 yen more expensive than the 5-speed model, but its smoothness makes full use of the rotary's characteristics. Moreover, it is fully suitable for sporty driving. 



The front disc/rear drum servo brakes have sufficient stopping power for the vehicle weight and power performance, except that the pedal feel is somewhat squishy and unreliable. In our fade test, we started from a standstill and accelerated until we reached a speed of 100km/h, then hit the brakes at the equivalent of 0.5g deceleration until we came to a stop, then immediately accelerated again, and repeated this ten times. The pedal force of 16kg for the first stop only increased to 23kg for the last, so it can be said that the fade resistance is extremely high.



As for fuel economy, the AP Luce we tested in last month's issue was extremely uneconomical, mainly at low and medium speeds, due to the rich mixture used to promote the reaction of the thermal reactor, so I was hoping that this model, which does not have such features, would improve upon it somewhat. However, after a test distance that included using the rev counter all the way up to 7000rpm and driving around Yatabe, Hakone, and Izu, the total fuel economy was 5.35km/l. I think this is the lowest figure this car can achieve. As expected, the fuel economy at low and medium speeds was far better than that of the AP model, which gave me some peace of mind.



The so-called cockpit-type driver's seat, with the entire instrument panel curved toward the driver, has a good relative positioning of the steering wheel, pedals, shift lever, etc., allowing the driver to adopt a very natural driving posture. The seat itself is a little short in length, but its excellent shape supports the body well, and the thick corduroy upholstery is non-slip and very useful. The rear seats are adequate in terms of size and legroom, but as is the fate of fastback-style cars, the rear window is quite steeply inclined, so if you sit back, the thick window frame will be right above your head. There is one switch for the optional power windows at each side, front and rear, and four are grouped together on the bottom right of the dashboard, but the latter are difficult to reach while driving (especially with the three-point seat belt fastened). The bi-level heater/ventilator is comfortable, and the outlets on both ends of the dash also bring in a surprising amount of air. As for the finer details, the wipers are very effective (this GSII also has an intermittent setting, with staggered wiper arms and blades), and the windscreen is well-cleared. 



As far as we can judge now, the Luce Hardtop GSII is a Capella that is slightly larger and more fully equipped. Its basic character as a long-distance and high-speed cruiser remains unchanged. However, its big appeal compared to the Capella is that with only a few adjustments to the steering and suspension, it can become a sporty car that can truly utilize the power of the flexible engine. The wide tread (1380mm)-to-height ratio of 1:1, which the manufacturer is proud of, the 5.5J rims, and the extemely wide tires must have all been for that purpose. The Luce which is a true joy to drive certainly existed, as we have driven it before. What I hope is that the production Luce will be restored to the specifications of the "early production prototype" (or "press test car") that we first drove in Izu.
