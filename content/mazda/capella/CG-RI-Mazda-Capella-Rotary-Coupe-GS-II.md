<b><u>Road testing the Mazda Capella Rotary Coupe GS II</b></u>





Last March, the Mazda Capella underwent a minor change. The "G series" was added in October last year, which also allowed the choice of an automatic transmission, and now the existing models have been reworked to catch up. At the same time, the lineup of variations was changed to match the Savanna/Grand Familia system, and at this time, the highest-end model in the series was born, the Capella Rotary Coupe GS II (Tokyo delivery price: 920,000 yen), which we tested over a distance of about 800km.



C/G immediately purchased an early Capella Rotary when the model was released in May 1970, and we used it for about 50,000km as a long-distance, high-speed vehicle until very recently. We have mentioned the details in the test report, but looking back now, in contrast to the extraordinary power performance, we repeatedly struggled to improve the extremely rough handling by, for example, widening the wheel rim size, changing the tires, strengthening the dampers, and even making the steering wheel smaller. 



These measures proved effective, and in the end the C/G Capella's handling became tolerable for sporty driving, but the fundamental characteristics of the car, such as strong understeer and slow steering, could not be significantly changed even with the fitment of Michelin XAS tires, so there was no choice but to wait for more extensive design changes. Our conclusion was that, if this maneuverability could be improved, the Capella would be a much more attractive long-distance tourer. 



So, at least on paper, the new GS II, with its stiffer suspension and 40mm lower ride height, should be the Capella that is closest to our ideal. The GS II also comes standard with a 5-speed gearbox, and the engine is slightly more powerful to deal with the vehicle weight of 980kg, which is 5kg heavier than the base GS.



If we talk about the test results in terms of handling, we can say that the Capella has made great strides in this respect. Compared to the base GS, the GS II suspension has significantly higher spring rates that are increased by about 23% for the front, from 1.6kg/mm to 2.0kg/mm, and about 35% for the rear, from 2.2kg/mm to 3.0kg/mm. Accordingly, the damping force of the dampers has also been increased by about 50% on both the compression and rebound sides, front and rear, compared to other models. In addition, as mentioned above, the overall height has been lowered by 40mm, and the wheel alignment of the front has also been slightly changed. 



The most obvious effect of this is the reduction in understeer. Compared to the early Capella, where the nose flared outward endlessly during cornering and the steering wheel had to be turned more and more dramatically, the reduction in understeer that was also observed in the G series released last year (with slightly stronger dampers and wider tires) is more pronounced in the GS II, and has been reduced to a standard level for this type of car. Therefore, the cornering posture is stable understeer regardless of speed. However, the limit is not very high, and at a certain point, the rear breaks away a little abruptly, and with the steering that still has an unpleasant feeling of twisting soft rubber when starting to turn, and the wheel with a thin rim and large diameter (which requires a firm grip, making it tiring for long drives), it is difficult to make quick corrections.



Considering the potential of the rear suspension of this car, the test car seemed to lose its grip on the road too early, but half the blame for this lies with the tires. The Bridgestone Super Speed Radial 20 tires (165SR-13 size) that were fitted this time did not feel stiff even at an air pressure of 2kg/cm², which is far above the manufacturer's recommendation, but the absolute value of adhesion was low, and the front outer tires, which bear a large load in downhill corners, tended to roll under. In C/G's experience, the Yokohama GT Special XX of the same size seems to be superior in terms of maneuverability (however, even with the standard GS suspension and 1.5kg/cm² pressure, the ride is quite stiff). The stiffened suspension itself did not seem to impair ride comfort as much as feared, and was much softer than the C/G Capella equipped with rally front dampers and Michelin XAS radials, picking up pavement joints only a little. The roll, which is still large, isn't too noticeable, but at higher speeds there was a tendency for the car to yaw a little when settling after bumps. 



The new gearbox, a 5-speed fully-synchronized gearbox exclusively for the GS II, is the 4-speed type (3.683 / 2.263 / 1.397 / 1.000) from the Capella with an indirect gear over-top (0.862). At the same time, the final drive ratio was lowered to 4.11, so the overall ratios are 15.141 / 9.303 / 5.743 / 4.111 / 3.544 (the tires are the same) compared to the 14.364 / 8.826 / 5.448 / 3.900 of other Capella models with the 3.90 final drive. This was expected to improve fuel consumption during high-speed cruising and improve power performance, including acceleration, but the results of the acceleration and top speed tests conducted at Yatabe did not fully meet our expectations. 



As part of the updates, the secondary jet of one of the four-barrel carburetors was made wider, the automatic ignition advance was set wider, and the exhaust pipe was partially widened, giving the new engine an output of 125ps/7000rpm (the rev counter is marked yellow from 6500rpm and red from 7000) and 16.3kgm/4000rpm, which is slightly stronger than the previous 120ps/6500rpm and 16.0kgm/3500rpm. However, the top speed was 181.8km/h in a flying kilometer and the acceleration time from 0-400m was 16.7 seconds. The C/G Capella that we tested previously, which was practically a new car that had only driven 2,000km, easily recorded a top speed 187.5km/h and 0-400m in 16.8 seconds. 



What I noticed here is that contrary to what it says on paper, the engine's power is lacking, and while it's fine at low and medium speeds, it clearly lacks punch at the top end after 5000rpm. So, even during sudden acceleration tests, there is less worry of over-revving, but you can't expect any explosive dashes before the redline either. The top speed in fifth gear is about 6700rpm, but if you run into a headwind zone, you can tell the top-end weakness by the rev counter needle dropping by 500 to 600rpm all at once. This is probably due to settings to comply with emission regulations. In other respects, this is still a rotary engine, and it goes without saying that it is unparalleled in its smoothness and quietness.



The new fifth gear is useful. It offers a lot of torque, so it can be used as more than just an overdrive. If you want, you can accelerate slowly from 45km/h (about 1500rpm) without any stress, so you can safely overtake other vehicles on normal highways without shifting down at all. However, the fifth gear itself emits a highly metallic noise, and because of the quietness of the engine, it is clearly audible along with the wind noise, which is by no means low. On the rev counter, 100km/h corresponds to 3700rpm in fourth gear, 3200rpm in fifth gear, and 160km/h corresponds to 5700rpm and 4900rpm, respectively, but the engine does not show a significant change in noise with this difference in revolutions, so in reality, using the fifth gear has little effect other than reducing fuel consumption.



To shift into fifth gear, you push the lever further to the right and forward in the usual H-pattern against a return spring, but the stroke on both sides is excessive, so you have to first return the shift lever to the neutral position, then pull it hard to the right and then push it forward, making for an exaggerated motion. The Capella's manual box has always had problems with the capacity of its synchros and the shift feeling, and these defects have been carried over into the GS II as well. The test car in particular had only recently been fitted with a new synchronizer ring, making it difficult to operate, but the synchro was still weak and could be easily overcome with quick shifts. 



The fuel economy, which is important, was poor at 4.84km/l in the test session at Yatabe, which included full-throttle acceleration runs, 5.19km/l in the city, and 6.71km/l on the Tomei Expressway and during a one-day tour to Hakone, for an overall average of 5.58km/l. However, this was the result of barely using fifth gear and driving around with complete disregard for fuel consumption. As long as you use it as a high-speed cruiser, which is what this car is designed to do, it is hard to imagine it getting any worse than this. Of course, it runs on regular fuel.



There is nothing particularly noteworthy about the interior or exterior of the body, other than it is very luxurious, as befits a high-priced domestic sports car, but even though it is a two-door coupe, it retains the traditional Capella good points, such as the rear quarter windows that can be rolled down with a regular and the powerful ventilation. Whether the metallic paint (including a striking purple, as on our test car), the optional stripes that can be applied to it, and the strangely shiny vinyl seats are good or bad is purely a matter of preference. 



Loaded with all this, the Capella Rotary Coupe GS II is fully qualified to be at the upper end of the Japanese market for this type of car, and although it has lost some of its once-ferocious punch, it is still unbeatable on the highway, and the fact that it combines its dynamic performance with the roominess and ride comfort of a practical car is something to be commended. It is C/G's hope that in the future, a Capella that combines the GS II's improved chassis with the "REmatic" JATCO automatic transmission will become a reality.
