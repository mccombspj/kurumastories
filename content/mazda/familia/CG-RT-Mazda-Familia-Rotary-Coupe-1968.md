<b>Summary:</b> <i>Car Graphic</i> purchased the Mazda Familia Rotary Coupe as soon as it was released. We immediately began our customary long-term practical testing. Our magazine has already purchased the Toyota Corolla, Bluebird 1300, Lotus Europa, and Nissan Laurel, one after the other, and is conducting controlled tests from a strictly neutral standpoint while also putting them to use in daily life. The Familia Rotary Coupe is our fifth attempt, having undergone long-term practical testing.





<b><u>Road testing the Familia Rotary Coupe</b></u>





The conclusion of testing the Familia Rotary Coupe for about 2000km is that, as far as power performance is concerned, it can be summed up in one word: excellent. On the 5.5km test course at Yatabe, our test car recorded a maximum speed of 184.0km/h (measured by the fifth wheel speedometer), an average speed of 179.7km/h over the 400m section (measured by photocell), a 0-400m time of 17.2 seconds, and a speed of 160km/h in 33.4 seconds, which is almost as high as the standard Lotus Elan. Moreover, while the Lotus is a pure two-seater sports car, the Rotary Coupe is a completely practical five-seater (at least legally) coupe, and above all, it is a low-priced car at 700,000 yen. 



The key to this amazing performance is, of course, the NSU-Wankel patented twin-rotor rotary engine, which is basically the same as the Cosmo's 491cc x 2 engine (L10B type) of which 340 have been sold since last June, but it has been slightly detuned and redesigned to suit mass production. Power is 100ps/7000rpm compared to the Cosmo's 128ps/7000rpm, and torque is 13.5kgm/3500rpm compared to the Cosmo's 14.2kgm/5000rpm. However, the weight is only 805kg, 150kg lighter than the Cosmo, so there is almost no difference in power-to-weight ratio.



The Cosmo engine is already known for its smoothness and flexibility, but the new Rotary Coupe's 100ps engine feels even more so. On cold mornings, it literally starts with a flick of the starter, and even if you immediately take your foot off the throttle, it continues to rotate smoothly at 600-700rpm (this is the rotation speed of the output shaft, and the rotor itself rotates at that speed). Even when you first take it out on the road after warming up, it immediately responds to the throttle and accelerates powerfully. 



The rev counter is in the yellow zone from 6500-7000rpm, and the red zone is 7000-8000rpm. The rotary engine has no valve gear to crash, and the intake and exhaust system is highly efficient, so the only thing that can stop it from over-revving is the driver's self-control. After the test, I read the manual carefully and it said that if the engine exceeds 7100rpm, plus or minus 200rpm, a buzzer goes off and there is a safety device that automatically cuts off the secondary fuel supply, but this (fortunately?) did not work on our test car. 



The smooth revving and good balancing can be compared to that of a well-tuned two-stroke engine. Two-strokes tend to be rough at low revs and have a narrow effective power band, but the Mazda rotary engine is surprisingly flexible down to low speeds and exerts strong torque over a very wide range. When you first get into this car, you want to drive it at high revs in low gears, partly out of curiosity and partly because of the engine's light-revving nature. But once the initial excitement has died down and you've regained your composure, you'll notice that you can drive it at lower revs than you'd expect. In fact, because of the ample power, once you get used to it, you can start quietly from 1000rpm, and according to the handbook, for the first 1000km of running in, you should keep the rotation below 3000rpm, but regardless of how it felt psychologically, in practice it was not at all inconvenient. Acceleration is extremely good, and even if you set the up-shift point to 3000rpm, by the time you shift into third gear, you'll have left other traffic behind. On the day I bought the C/G Rotary Coupe, I took it to and from the FISCO circuit to do some running-in, and I didn't feel any inconvenience, as it could reach about 90km/h at 3000rpm even on the Tomei Expressway.



The Rotary Coupe is a very easy car to drive in the city. With its large reserve of horsepower, even beginners will find it very easy to drive. Even though it is a rotary engine, no special techniques are required. As mentioned above, its flexibility at low speeds is exceptionally good, and it can be driven at speeds as low as 30km/h in top gear (about 1100rpm). So you can drive quietly, sticking to the 50km/h speed limit and using third and fourth gears half-and-half. The exhaust note is probably one of the quietest of any car. You can barely hear it inside the car until you exceed 80km/h, and it only gets a little louder when accelerating.



But the real strength of a rotary engine car is in high-speed driving using high revolutions to the fullest. If you push the engine up to 7000rpm, which corresponds to the maximum output, you can easily reach 90km/h in second gear and 135km/h in third gear, and the feeling is that the revolutions will only continue to increase from there. The smoothness and immediacy of the acceleration in response to the throttle at around 2500-5000rpm in third gear is something that no reciprocating engine can come close to. The engine noise level increases slightly from around 4000rpm, but does not change much from there up to the redline. Because it is quiet and the balancing (not only of the engine but of the entire drive system) is exceptionally good, even at top speed, there is no sense of tension even when driving at 180km/h.



There is not even a trace of the roughness often found in high-performance cars; it feels as if the numbers calculated coldly by computer are displayed exactly as calculated on the tachometer and speedometer.



The maximum speed is exactly as the catalog value indicates. With two crew members and about 50kg of test equipment (including the fifth wheel) on board, the vehicle made four consecutive laps around the 5.5km circuit at Yatabe, maintaining a speed of 170-180km/h. The maximum instantaneous speed shown on the fifth wheel speedometer was 184.0km/h (the engine was at 6500rpm, and the car's speedometer indicated 200km/h). The average speed measured by the photocell over a 400m section was 179.7km/h.



The engine was in good condition throughout the 2000km test period. The water temperature was always around 80°C even in crowded city traffic jams, and only when we ran at top speed continuously at Yatabe did it approach the upper limit of the normal range (80°C-105°C). The idling became rough and the engine stalled every time we braked suddenly during the brake test. Although we used a cold type B-9EPD plug during the high-speed test, it sometimes backfired when decelerating with engine braking. Also, when we stopped the car for a while and restarted it while still warm, the engine started to stall. When restarting, I had to turn the starter for quite a long time. The latter may not have been due to the plugs themselves, but rather fuel percolation caused by heat. I used B-8EE plugs for normal driving, but after about 800km the idling became a little rough and there were misfires, so I inspected them (the plug wrench that came with the car was cheap and broke easily), and found that the lead side of the number four plug was particularly burnt and that all of them were heavily covered with combustion deposits. Other than that, this engine has been completely trouble-free so far.



The gearbox matches the engine's output characteristics well. Shift feel is good, the lever engages easily even when it was new, and the synchro is extremely powerful. The clutch is also light to operate (but has a slightly long stroke), and the engagement is incredibly smooth, so no beginner will have any excuse to make a poor start.



The final drive ratio is 3.70, which is naturally taller than the Familia Coupe with a 1200cc 68ps reciprocating engine (priced at 550,000 yen), which was released at the same time as the Rotary Coupe, and the gear speed per 1000rpm is 27.6km/h. On the highway, cruising in fourth gear at 100km/h is about 3600rpm, which almost coincides with the maximum torque point of 13.5kgm. Therefore, the acceleration in top gear is still strong, and there is a clear response when you step on the gas. From the point of view of dynamic performance, the Rotary Coupe is ideal for high-speed motorway travel.



High-speed performance cannot be achieved safely without reliable braking force, and the Rotary Coupe has no problems in this regard. The brakes are Girling type SC discs in the front, and leading/trailing show drums at the rear, and the hydraulic system is independent for the front and rear. There is no servo, but the pedal force is generally light, there is none of the squealing sound that is common with discs, and the brakes are stable even when stepped on at high speeds. In the 0-100-0 fade test described earlier, the pedal force was 20kg for the first two stops, 28kg for the third stop, and 30kg thereafter, and did not increase any further. This level of pedal force increase is considered normal.



The suspension is based on the conventional Familia sedan, but is generally stiffer. As I have pointed out before, the Familia's directional stability is slightly affected by crosswinds, and the Rotary Coupe is also pushed around quite a bit at speeds over 100km/h. Fortunately, there was almost no crosswind during the test at Yatabe, so I was able to achieve the maximum speed without worry, but on highways that passed over high places, like long bridges, I had to constantly make steering corrections on windy days.



The test car was fitted with low-profile, Toyo 6.15-13 tires, but they were no match for the car's high speeds. At Yatabe we started out with a tire pressure of 2kg/cm² front and rear, but after four or five laps at top speed the tires became too hot to touch with your hands and the tire pressure rose to 2.5kg/cm². Drivers who regularly drive at high speeds should definitely consider installing the optional 155SR-13 radials.



The ride is quite stiff. It absorbs small irregularities in the road surface well, but reacts surprisingly badly to larger bumps. When turning a tight corner in low gear and applying power, the rear wheels easily lose grip and spin. This indicates the low level of tire adhesion as well as the inferior performance of the suspension.



The handling is basically safe, with moderate understeer, but swapping the tires for radials with more cornering power would be a huge improvement. The steering is incredibly light when parking, yet still sure at high speeds, with very little road kickback reaching your hands.



Next, regarding the interior, it is so luxurious that it is hard to believe this is a 700,000 yen car. The reclining seats are covered in the same black-and-white checkered woven fabric as the Cosmo, and are among the best in a domestic car. Height-adjustable headrests and three-point seat belts are standard equipment. The seat dimensions are adequate, allowing a 180cm tall driver to maintain a comfortable driving posture. 



The placement of the controls is appropriate, with the only exceptions being the clutch and brake pedals, both of which are are too far away from the floor (and have a long stroke), making them difficult to press with a comfortably extended foot. The instrument design is good and very simple, but the speedometer and rev counter could be moved 50mm further away, where they would be closer to the line of sight while driving and easier to see, and would not obstruct the forward view. The only fine control is the multi-purpose lever to the right of the steering wheel, with the same design as the Cosmo, which allows you to operate the the wipers screen jets, headlights, and turn signals without taking your hands off the steering wheel.



The seating capacity is five, but the Rotary Coupe is effectively a 2+2 setup, with the rear backrests being almost upright, meaning that headroom is barely adequate for average-sized adults, and legroom is also inadequate unless the front seats are pushed forward quite far (in which case the front passenger's knees hit the bottom edge of the dash).



The Familia has an unusually good ventilation system for a low-cost car, and this coupe has the same system, but without the triangular window. There are vents on both sides of the dash and in the footwell. This is extremely effective, and on the highway, even in hot weather, you can keep the windows closed and still get a decent amount of ventilation. However, after driving on the highway for a while, the floor gradually gets hot, which is a problem. This is apparently because the exhaust pipes are close to the floor. This is a shame, as this is a car with good ventilation.



Finally, a note on fuel economy. It is said that the rotary engine's weakness is its poor fuel economy, and this test proved this to be true to a certain extent. The constant speed fuel economy was 13.5km/l at 40km/h, but dropped to 8.9km/l at 100km/h. When measured in real-world driving from full to empty, the the worst result was 5.6km/l when driving only short distances, and the best result was 9.9km/l when driving on the highway, including a round trip to Yatabe, and the overall average so far has remained at 6.2km/l. However, this rotary engine can run on regular gasoline despite its high compression ratio of 9.4, so the high fuel consumption will be offset to some extent. Oil consumption was 4 liters over 300km, including the testing at Yatabe.



With acceleration on par with that of a 2-liter sports car, an exceptionally small turning radius of 4.1m, and a rotary engine that is easier to use at low speeds than the average reciprocating engine, this coupe is the perfect city runabout for modern metropolitan traffic conditions. Our conclusion is that for grand touring on the highway, another specialty of this car, a chassis worthy of the wonderful rotary engine is required, even if the price is high for this reason.
