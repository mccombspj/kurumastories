<b>Summary:</b> A fun car with the 1.6-liter DOHC engine from the Celica/Carina GT mounted in a Corolla body. It is powerful, flexible, and has an excellent gearbox, but is slightly low-geared overall. The ride and roominess are adequate despite the reinforced suspension, and the maneuverability is excellent thanks to the 175-width tires, but fuel economy is poor and the noise level is high.





<b><u>Road testing the Toyota Corolla Levin 1600</b></u>





When talking about Japanese practical cars, the Toyota Corolla is always one of the first names to be mentioned. Not only in terms of production and sales volume, but also in terms of the structure and equipment of the car itself, it has always led the market as a product of Japan's largest car manufacturer, and for better or worse, it has a tremendous influence on others, and can be said to qualify as a representative domestic car. As a result, the Corolla series encompasses an extremely broad range of vehicle categories, and a wide price range from 438,500 yen (1200 Standard 2-door sedan) to 644,000 yen (1400 Coupe SR), due to the complex permutations and combinations of mechanical components such as body shells, engines, gearboxes, and brakes, and a number of accessories that are too numerous to mention. The Toyota Sprinter series, which started as a variation of the Corolla, boasts an almost identical lineup, so it is no exaggeration to say that Toyota offers a model that will meet the needs of any user in this class of car.



Naturally, enthusiast specifications are also available, and the current sports models include two SLs, the 1200 and 1400 (each available in coupe and two-door sedan form), and the SR, which has a 5-speed gearbox and a stiffened chassis, making it the highest-performance and highest-priced model in the series. All of these models have high levels of power performance and ease of handling, and while they are not particularly outstanding in any respect, they offer a reasonably well-balanced combination of maneuverability and roominess, as well as a full range of accessories that are out of line with their price, making them very popular in the market. In addition, the fully tuned works versions based on these models have had a strong presence recently in domestic touring car races. 



However, there are always stubborn people, and those who call themselves hardcore (or serious) enthusiasts prefer to drive cars that are not very economical or realistic, such as the Skyline GT-R, Bellett GTR, Corona Mark II GSS, and Galant GTO MR, judging their value purely on their performance specs. Although these cars are still a minority in terms of production numbers, they have a great advertising effect as image leaders for their respective series, and they have the effect of giving users the illusion that all of their variations are in line with these "super sports" models. Of course, it is only natural that profit-savvy Toyota would use this technique with its cash cow series, and in March of this year they announced a Corolla smothered in hot sauce, named the Levin, and its Sprinter twin, called the Trueno.



The specs are quite attractive. The Levin is equipped with a 1.6-liter DOHC 115hp four-cylinder, which is also found in the Celica/Carina GT, mated to a 5-speed floor-shift gearbox. The suspension is the same basic Corolla layout, but the springs and dampers have been significantly strengthened, the 5J x 13 wheels are one inch wider than standard, and the 175/70HR-13 tires are unusually large for a domestically produced compact car. The stabilizer has also been made thicker, from 19mm to 21mm in diameter, and the steering gear ratio is faster at 16.1:1 compared to the standard 18.2:1. The biggest external features are the removal of the rear spoiler and the inclusion of over-fenders to clear the wide tires. 



With all of these improvements, there is no denying the Levin 1600's appeal, and as the C/G editors are also enthusiasts who value performance above all else, we immediately brought one to Yatabe. The test car was painted a deep army green (a dark orange is also available), and was equipped with optional parts such as a 25,000 yen limited-slip differential, a radio, a defroster, a passenger footrest, and a clock.



The 2T-G type 1.6-liter DOHC engine shared with the Celica/Carina GT starts up vigorously even in the early morning without pulling the choke, just by gently tapping the throttle and pumping gas into the twin Solex 40PHH3 carburetors, and it shows almost no hesitation when it first starts moving, pulling powerfully in each gear. It doesn't warm up quickly unless it's under load, but once it's warmed up, it naturally idles at about 900rpm. 



The first thing that impresses you when you start driving the Levin is how responsive it is. With a body that is 85kg lighter than the Celica and 90kg lighter than the Carina, and with the gearing set slightly shorter overall, not only does the rev counter needle reach the 7000rpm limit (the yellow zone is from 6500rpm) in the blink of an eye in the lower gears, but if you're not careful the revs can easily surpass the limit and continue to rise. The maximum speed in each gear at 7000rpm is 50km/h in first, 90km/h in second, 130km/h in third, and 177km/h in fourth (where it will still reach the 7000rpm limit). Throttle response is extremely sharp regardless of the revs, and especially once it passes around 5000rpm, which is close to the peak of the torque curve, it feels fully "on cam," accompanied by the metallic power roar that is characteristic of a high-performance DOHC unit, and shows an explosive dash that shows no change at all up to the top end.



On the other hand, the engine continues to produce more than 80% (11.6kgm) of the maximum torque value over a wide rev range, from just over 3000rpm to around 6800rpm, so combined with the weight of the car and the gear ratio, it has an incredibly eager nature, like a bouncy rubber ball, even at ultra-low speeds, which is another desirable feature. For example, the overtaking times from 20-60km/h, 40-80km/h, 60-100kmh, and 80-120km/h are all concentrated in the six-second range, and even from 1300rpm (30km/h) in fourth gear and 1500rpm (40km/h) in fifth gear, it accelerates smoothly without detonation, albeit quite slowly, demonstrating the wide power band. 



This combination of strong punch at high speeds and sufficient flexibility at low revolutions (there are factors other than the engine itself that contribute to this, but we will discuss that later), which should be mutually exclusive, makes for truly excellent dynamic performance. The day of our testing at Yatabe was spoiled by strong crosswinds, and the recorded top speed was 182.2km/h in a straight flying kilometer, lower than the catalog's "estimated" value of 190km/h. On the other hand, the 0-400m acceleration time was 16.1 seconds on average, and 15.9 seconds with a tailwind, significantly quicker than the manufacturer's published value (16.3 seconds). These results were achieved while keeping to the allowable rev range and shifting up at 7000rpm. It is safe to say that the top speed could have been a little higher if the conditions had been better.



As far as domestic sports cars tested by C/G go, other than the Fairlady 240ZG (which has a 2.4-liter six-cylinder), the Levin is behind the Skyline GT-R in top speed (182.2km/h vs 185.6km/h) and 0-100km/h acceleration (9.6 vs 9.4 seconds), and cannot match the maximum speed of the Capella Rotary (187.5km/h), but the Levin's outstanding speed potential is at an exceptionally high level. If we place it in context within the 1.6-liter class and 800,000 yen price range, there is nothing that comes close to it in terms of power performance. 



The difficulty with this engine is noise and vibration. It is not particularly rough, and there is no resonance period in a specific rotation range, but the high-frequency vibrations generated by the engine itself are constantly transmitted through the entire body. This phenomenon does not occur in the Celica or Carina, or if it does, it is very slight, so we think that the engine mounts are probably made of a harder rubber material. This is evident when the body sways like a large-engined car when blipping the throttle at a standstill. In short, the connection between the engine and the body is very rigid, and for the same reason, the noise level is also loud despite the soundproofing materials on the firewall and floor. Some mechanical noise is transmitted at any speed, and when the engine speed exceeds 4000rpm, the exhaust system produces a loud resonance that is trapped in the body. This is something that could be easily solved by increasing the thickness of the exhaust pipe and silencer plates even a little.



The clutch is the same as that of the Celica GT. The pedal stroke is just right, the force required to depress it is light, and the engagement is smooth. In the test car, the pedal was adjusted with too little play, meaning that the engagement point was too far forward, which meant that the driver was prone to pressing the throttle too hard when starting off. Even so, after repeated and harsh standing-start acceleration, there was no change in the pedal stroke or any sign of slipping. 



The gearbox is also one of the car's strengths. It is a fully synchronized 5-speed (the gear ratios are 3,587, 2.022, 1.384, 1.000, 0.861) that is shared with the Celica, Carina, and Corolla SR/SL, with fifth gear to the upper right of the normal H-pattern and reverse at the lower right. The shift feel, lever movement, synchronizer capacity, and gear ratio spacing are all appropriate for the power unit, and it is a world apart from the generally poorly regarded Toyota gearboxes of the past. We would recommend it as an excellent example of a Japanese gearbox, alongside the 4-speed type in the Sunny 1200. However, on our test car, a loud gear whine was heard when engine braking was applied in second gear.



In the Levin, this gearbox is combined with a 4.30 final drive ratio. Considering the engine's power and torque characteristics, vehicle weight, and tire size, this may be a little too low. The remarkably fast acceleration from a standing start and the extremely tenacious engine response are mainly due to this short gearing. If we compare the combinations of this gearbox with taller Toyota final drive sets that should be technically compatible, such as the Celica/Carina's 3.90 unit, and considering the Levin's sufficient torque and light weight, it should be theoretically possible to maintain the same ease of handling while increasing the maximum speeds in each gear, which would be an improvement. We don't think there is anyone who would try to drive this type of car at 40km/h in fifth gear, so it would be preferable to offer another final drive ratio, if only as an option.



Shifting up from fourth to fifth gear requires pushing against the return spring, but it is done very naturally without any undue force or motion. The same goes for dowshifting from fifth to fourth. The abundant torque makes it possible to use any of the top three gears equally well in city driving, and it is also possible to overtake in fifth gear on the highway. As the fifth gear is indirect, gear whine makes itself heard, but it is drowned out by the engine noise and is hardly noticeable. The engine speed at 100km/h is about 4100rpm in fourth gear and about 3500rpm in fifth gear. Tire noise is also hard to single out over the generally high noise level.



The handling is outstanding and is best summed up in one word: exhilarating. The character created by the combination of powerful throttle response, appropriately reinforced suspension, and thick tires is somewhat classical overall, but that is why it is always possible to drive it intuitively like a sports car. Compared to the SR, which was the highest performance version of the Corolla up until now, the Levin's front and rear spring constants are much higher at 2.65kg/2.5kg, compared with the SR's 2.2kg/2.2kg, and the compression/extension force of the front and rear dampers are 30kg/105kg and 60kg/80kg, compared with the SR's 55kg/78kg and 30kg/72kg. The reason for reducing the front dampers' compression force is unclear, but everything else is significantly increased. 



The tires are 175/70HR-13, which are combined with 5J rim wheels. The SR has 4J wheels with 155-width tires, and the designers' decision to fit such a large tire to a body of this size is highly commendable. The test car was fitted with Sumitomo Dunlop SP Sport Deluve 70s, and as we will discuss later, the Levin's handling is greatly influenced by these tires.



Like other Corollas, the driving position is good. The Levin-exclusive semi-bucket seats, which use rubber springs and lots of urethane foam, offer a slightly lower seating position than conventional models, allowing you to stretch your arms and legs out comfortably. The driver can choose a natural posture regardless of his or her physique, and the relative positions of the shift lever, handbrake, etc. are also good. The throttle pedal is a suspended type made of steel plate, just like the new Mark II GSS, and is suitable for heel-and-toe driving, but a common drawback of the Corolla series is that all three pedals are high off the floor, making it difficult to step on them without lifting your heels. A sturdy footrest is standard on the left side of the clutch pedal, and the test car was equipped with optional accessories such as a "foot support" that supports the driver's right ankle (which can also be used as a storage space) and two footrests on the passenger's side, all of which are very useful when driving fast on winding roads. 



Two large gauges are positioned in front of the driver, a rev counter (marked up to 8000rpm) on the right, and a speedometer (marked up to 200km/h, and with a built-in odometer and trip counter) on the left, and there is a combination gauge for water temperature and fuel in between. These are not obstructed by the steering wheel and are easy to read day or night. Unfortunately, the light and wiper switches have still not improved at all. Because they are located on the instrument panel, they are difficult to reach when the three-point seat belt is fastened, and the knobs are small and difficult to use. Moreover, since they are on the left and ride sides of the steering wheel, the worst case is that you have to take both hands off the wheel to operate them at once. We would like to urge the designers to seriously reflect on this. The three small gauges in the center of the dash are the current, oil temperature, and oil pressure. After 2-3 laps at top speed at Yatabe, the oil temperature gauge rose over the 130°C mark and the oil pressure dropped to 2kg/cm². Normally, the oil pressure is around 4.5kg and the oil temperature is 80-95°C. 



The steering ratio has been reduced from the standard 18.2:1 (3.5 turns lock-to-lock) to 16.1:1 (2.8 turns). It doesn't feel as quick as the lock-to-lock figure suggests because it is offset by the reduced maximum turning angle due to the wider tires, but it still feels very responsive. It is precise enough for high-speed driving, and not unduly heavy except at very low speeds. However, the free play of 4-5cm at the rim when going straight requires you to concentrate to keep the car on course on the highway, as this car has weak resistance to crosswinds to begin with.



In normal driving, cornering is dominated by strong understeer from entry to exit. The front tires start to squeal relatively early, but there is still plenty of grip margin, so you don't need to put both arms into it too often. The caster action is quite strong, so it is important to hold the steering wheel firmly. All the sporty Corollas have been best suited to roads with a series of medium-speed corners at 70-100km/h. The same is true for the Levin, where you can alternate between third and fourth gears depending on your mood, and force your way through with a steady foot on the throttle. Due to the strong understeer, the car does tend to push to the outside just past the apex, but by gently easing off the throttle, the nose is gently pulled back to the inside, as is the rule for a nose heavy car (the weight distribution is 58.5% front, 41.5% rear). The power reserve makes this control easy, and the Levin's true potential is best enjoyed when cornering tightly under power.



We found that the Levin's preferred method for tackling corners is as follows: approach the corner by repeatedly downshifting with heel-and-toe, then turn the steering wheel sharply in second gear to enter the corner. When you reach the apex, open the throttle as much as possible, and the tail slides out very smoothly. It's not an abrupt motion like you sometimes experience in other Corollas, and it's extremely easy to control. At this point, with just one movement of the right foot, you can freely choose the direction of the car. At the same time, release the steering wheel, lint up straight for the next corner, and then press the throttle assertively. The ability to perform these actions smoothly in a short amount of time is perhaps the true essence of the Levin. If a conventional Corolla were to go around the same corner, the inside rear wheel would tend to lift up and spin violently, losing all power. The Levin's much-improved behavior is probably due to the thick stabilizer that keeps body roll to a minimum, and the limited-slip differential settings being just right. It would be interesting to see how a Levin without these mechanisms would behave. 



What is noteworthy is that, even though this suspension has been designed to maximize maneuverability, there was very little of the roughness that we anticipated. Certainly, the ride is firm, even with the low specified tire pressure of 1.5kg/cm² for both front and rear (1.6kg/cm² was used for testing). However, the strong dampers ensure that the shock of going over bumps is contained with only a single up-and-down motion, and passengers are unlikely to be thrown out of their seats. The suspension faithfully picks up the fine bumps on the pavement, concrete joints, and cat's eyes on the center line, but the excellent seats absorb them, so that they are heard more than felt, and the ride gives the impression of being extremely flat, as if you were riding in a much heavier car. The rear wheel load is relatively small, and for a model with a rigid axle suspended only by stiff leaf springs, the tail shows no unusual tendency to bounce. Even during standing-start acceleration tests at Yatabe, this rear suspension did not allow axle tramp. Given all this, even if the tire pressure were increased slightly, it would have almost no adverse effect on ride comfort, so it would also be realistic to raise only the front pressure a little and reduce understeer.



The brakes, which consist of discs in the front and leading/trailing drums at the rear, have a front disc diameter that is 2.2mm larger than that of the SR, providing sufficient stopping power for the Levin's power performance. In the 0-100-0 fade resistance test, in which we accelerate from a standstill to 100km/h at full throttle, then brake at 0.5g to a stop, and repeat this ten times, the pedal force increased from 28kg on the first stop to 39kg on the ninth stop, but remained stable throughout, and no smoke or smells were observed, so the performance can be said to be very good. However, as can be seen from the test results, a large pedal force is required overall. In our past road test of the SR, we commented that the brakes were "at the limit of what can be used without a servo," but with the Levin, it is now clear that some kind of power assist is required. It should be available, if only as an option. 



Aside from the force required, pedal feel is good. The braking effect is exactly proportional to the slightest change in pedal force (0.46g with 20kg of pedal pressure, 0.83g with 40kg of pressure), and there is little change in posture during sudden braking, so you can always step on the pedal with complete confidence. The proportioning control valve and tire grip work together to keep rear wheel lock in check. As an aside, the lid of the reserve tank for the tandem master cylinder needs to be made sturdier. The existing lid is made of thin rubber and is too weakly attached, so it comes off easily when glanced by a tool, and there is a high possibility that you will drive off without noticing it. This happened to us while working in the pit at Yatabe.



Fuel consumption is very high. Even at a constant speed, the Levin’s fuel consumption is worse than you’d expect for its performance, and when actually driving the Levin quickly, the accelerator pump discharge volume is large, probably because of the emphasis on response. The average fuel consumption was 6.9km/l on a round from from Tokyo to Yatabe, including the high-speed test session there, 6.7km/l in the city, and 7.1km/l on a day of enjoying the mountain roads of Izu and Hakone via the Tomei Expressway. A large amount of premium gasoline was consumed. The total average was 6.9km/l, and with a 45-liter fuel tank, the range was at most 250km. It's not a problem because this is not the kind of car where fuel efficiency is not a big concern, but it would be a little more economical if the gearing was taller. The Levin series also has a regular gasoline model whose output is only 5ps lower.



The Corolla Levin, with its compact body and powerful DOHC engine, is the Japanese equivalent of the Escort RS (the TC is no longer in production). Compared to the RS, a detuned racing sedan, the Levin is superior in that it offers extremely high levels of maneuverability, livability, power performance, and flexibility. In that sense, although it looks like a fairly normal coupe, it is in fact a "fun car" that exists only for the pleasure of driving. The price of 813,000 yen in standard form is reasonable, its performance will easily surpass the Celica GT if you order practical accessories such as a limited-slip differential, and it is hard to give up the fun of legally racing on the highway.
