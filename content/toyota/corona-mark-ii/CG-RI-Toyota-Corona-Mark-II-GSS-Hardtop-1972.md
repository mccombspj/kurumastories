<b><u>Road testing the Toyota Corona Mark II Hardtop GSS</b></u>



In the April issue, we reported on the Corona Mark II 2000GSS with simple measurements taken at the Murayama test course and handling impressions from the winding roads of Okutama. This time, we took the Corona Mark II GSS to the Yatabe test course to measure its top speed and standing-start acceleration. We also brought three other cars to Yatabe at the same time: a BMW 2002tii, a Corolla Levin 1600, and  Capella GS-II. As a result, we had four cars with catalog top speeds of around 190km/h gathered together. The GSS had the highest power output of the four cars, but at the same time, it was handicapped by having the largest exterior dimensions and having to pull the heaviest weight. 

When comparing the main specifications of the new Mark II 2000GSS with the previous Mark II 1900GSS, the new model has an engine displacement of 1968cc, a power output of 145ps/6400rpm and 18.0kgm/5200rpm, a curb weight of 1105kg, and a power-to-weight ratio of 7.62kg/ps. The figures for the previous GSS are 1858cc, 140ps/6400rpm, 17.0kgm/5200rpm, 1050kg, and 7.50kg/ps, respectively. As you can see, the new car's power-to-weight ratio is inferior to the old car. 

On the other hand, the ratios of the 5-speed fully synchronized gearbox are not that different between the old and new models. The new GSS' gear ratios are 3.055 / 1.879 / 1.296 / 1.000 / 0.858, while those of the old GSS are 3.074 / 1.838 / 1.256 / 1.000 / 0.856. The final drive ratio of their differentials, which are both limited-slip, is also the same at 4.375, and the tire size is the same, at 165R-14 (the test car had Bridgestone Radial 20s), so the gearing of both cars can be said to be nearly identical.  

The test car was the same car reported on in the April issue, the hottest premium-gasoline model with a high compression ratio of 9.4, and the catalog boasts a top speed of 195km/h (the regular-gasoline model has a compression ratio of 8.5, so it has 140ps/6400rpm, 17.2kgm/5200rpm, and a catalog top speed of 190km/h).

Unfortunately, the result of running the Mark II 2000GSS at Yatabe was that it showed performance far below the catalog figures. First of all, in terms of top speed, when you wind the engine up to 7000rpm where the red zone begins, the speedometer shows 60km/h in first gear, 100km/h in second gear, and 150km/h in third gear, but in direct fourth gear, even at full throttle, the rev counter only reaches 6500rpm. It is actually faster when shifted up to fifth gear. In fifth gear, the revs reach 6000rpm for a moment, and the speedometer needle touches 192km/h. (The calculated value for 6000rpm in fifth gear is 177km/h, so the speedometer over-reads by about 10%). In the end, the actual results measured by stopwatch were 175.8km/h on the 1km straight section, and 172km/h over the 5.5km course.  

This is slower than the top speed of the previous 1900GSS, which reached 184.7km/h over the 5.5km course in our road test (C/G, January 1970). The new twin cam engine lost power after the peak power speed of 6400rpm, and felt most powerful around 6000rpm. It should be noted that at the time were testing the new GSS, the wind at Yatabe had gotten quite strong, reaching maximum gusts of 14m/s. So this data, which was slowest of the four cars we brought for testing, should be taken with a grain of salt. 

Standing-start acceleration was also the slowest of the four. The slipping clutch we reported in the April issue had been repaired, but even though there was no handicap from that, the GSS was slower than the other three cars. We revved the engine up to 7000rpm in each gear, and the best times were 0-400m in 17.0 seconds and 0-1000m in 32.0 seconds (the old GSS' times were 16.6 seconds and 29.9 seconds, respectively). The smooth but slow clutch, which is like that of a passenger car, and the floor shift lever, with its fairly large shift stroke, must have been factors that slowed down the acceleration times. 

While the power drops at the top end, the low-speed performance is good, as is the case with most high-performance Japanese engines. If you feel like it, you can accelerate smoothly and reliably from just under 50km/h (about 1600rpm) in fourth gear and just under 60km/h (about 1800rpm) in fifth gear.

Regarding handling, our impressions from the April issue were merely confirmed. In other words, the relatively precise but heavy, slow, and busy steering and the tendency for early final oversteer mean that the handling is not suitable for high-speed driving on winding roads. Another thing became clear during the test due to the strong winds. Despite its heavy weight, the Mark II is not strong against crosswinds, and its large body is blown around quite significantly, although not as suddenly as a lighter car. To make matters worse, the Mark II does not have the quick steering needed to immediately correct this tendency.

Finally, the fuel economy was 6.37km/l over the full test distance, which included the crowded National Route 6 and high-speed driving at Yatabe, and 6.15km/l on the same Route 6 and in Tokyo. Of course, the gasoline used was high octane.

To put it bluntly, one could say that there is no need for the GSS with its twin cam engine to exist in the large and heavy Mark II series. If you want to drive fast with a sports-car feel, there's the Corolla Levin, if you want a car with a sporty mood, there's the Celica GT, and if this car isn't aiming for the hard-edged character of the Skyline GT-R and is simply meant to rival the SOHC Skyline GT, then the Mark II GSL, with its SOHC twin-SU engine, is already sufficient. Only those who are in love with the styling of the Mark II, and who won't be satisfied unless they open the hood to see the crackle-black-finished twin cams, would find it worth spending 1.15 million yen on this car.
